Use the backslash character (``\``) as an escape character when quotes must appear within strings. However, you do not need to escape single quotes inside double quotes. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   'It\'s alive!'                        # => "It's alive!"
   "Won't you read Grant's book?"      # => "Won't you read Grant's book?"
