A Boolean operator can be used to make a search query more specific by ensuring that certain terms are included in the results, excluded from the results, or not included even when other aspects of the query match:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Boolean Operator
     - Description
   * - ``AND``
     - Use to find a match when both terms exist.
   * - ``OR``
     - Use to find a match if either term exists.
   * - ``NOT``
     - Use to exclude the term after NOT from the search results.

Boolean operators must be in ALL CAPS. Parentheses can be used to group clauses and to form sub-queries.
