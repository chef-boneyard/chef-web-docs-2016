|kitchen| uses a driver plugin architecture to enable |kitchen| to simulate testing on cloud providers, such as |amazon ec2|, |openstack|, and |rackspace|, and also on non-cloud platforms, such as |windows|. Each driver is responsible for managing a virtual instance of that platform so that it may be used by |kitchen| during cookbook testing.

.. note:: The |chef dk| includes the ``kitchen-vagrant`` driver.

Most drivers have driver-specific configuration settings that must be added to the |kitchen yml| file before |kitchen| will be able to use that platform during cookbook testing. For information about these driver-specific settings, please refer to the driver-specific documentation.
