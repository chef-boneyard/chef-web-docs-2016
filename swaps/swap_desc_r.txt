The file in a cookbook is selected according to file specificity, which allows different source files to be used based on the hostname, host platform (operating system, distro, or as appropriate), or platform version. Place files under COOKBOOK_NAME/files/default to use them on any platform.
.. |resource desc cron| replace:: The |resource cron| resource is used to manage |cron| entries for time-based job scheduling. Attributes for a schedule will default to ``*`` of not provided, so only specify scheduling attributes that are applicable to a |cron| entry. The |resource cron| resource requires that a package be installed that provides the |crontab| program, typically |cron|.
.. |resource desc deploy| replace:: The |resource deploy| resource is used to manage and control deployments. There is a large number of attributes available for this resource that can be used to specify many different behaviors. Please review them carefully before deciding on which approach is required for a particular recipe.
.. |resource desc directory| replace:: The |resource directory| resource is used to manage a directory.

.. |resource desc erlang_call| replace:: The |resource erlang call| resource is used to connect to a node located within a distributed |erlang| system. An |resource erlang call| resource is not idempotent. Use the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` meta parameters to guard the use of this resource for idempotence.
.. |resource desc execute| replace:: The |resource execute| resource is used to execute a command. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` meta parameters to guard the use of this resource for idempotence.
.. |resource desc file| replace:: The |resource file| resource is used to manage files that are present on a node, including setting or updating the contents of those files.
.. |resource desc group| replace:: The |resource group| resource is used to manage a local group.

.. |resource desc link| replace:: The |resource link| resource is used to create symbolic or hard links.
.. |resource desc log| replace:: The |resource log| resource is used to create log entries from a recipe.
.. |resource desc mdadm| replace:: The |resource mdadm| resource is used to manage |mdadm| software |raid| devices in a |linux| environment. The |resource mdadm| provider will create and assemble an array, but it will not create the config file that is used to persist the array upon reboot. If the config file is required, it must be done by specifying a template with the correct array layout, and then by using the |resource mount| provider to create a file systems table (fstab) entry.
.. |resource desc mount| replace:: The |resource mount| resource is used to manage a mounted file system.
.. |resource desc ohai| replace:: The |resource ohai| resource is used to re-load the |ohai| configuration on a node. This allows recipes that change system attributes (like adding a user) to refer to those attributes later on during the |chef| run.
.. |resource desc package| replace:: The |resource package| resource is used to manage packages. When the package is installed from a local file (such as |rubygems| |debian dkpg| or |rpm|) the file must be added to the node using the |resource remote file| or |resource cookbook file| resources.
.. |resource desc powershell_script| replace:: The |resource powershell script| resource is used to execute a script using the |windows powershell| interpreter. This resource is used just like the |resource script| resource or the providers for |bash|, |csh|, |perl|, |python|, and |ruby|. The |resource powershell script| resource is similar to those, but with some small tweaks under the covers for the |windows| platform and |windows powershell| interpreter. This resource creates and executes a temporary file (similar to the |resource script| resource), rather than running it inline. This resource includes actions (``:run`` and ``:nothing``; ) and attributes (``creates``, ``cwd``, ``environment``, ``group``, ``path``, ``timeout``, and ``user``) that are available from the |resource execute| resource. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` meta parameters to guard the use of this resource for idempotence.
.. |resource desc remote_directory| replace:: The |resource remote directory| resource is used to recursively transfer a directory from a cookbook's files or default directory. A remote directory will obey file specificity; the directory that will be copied should be located under COOKBOOK_NAME/files/default/REMOTE_DIRECTORY. A host-or distribution-specific path can also be used.
.. |resource desc remote_file| replace:: The |resource remote file| resource is used to transfer a file from a remote location using file specificity. This resource is similar to |resource file|.
.. |resource desc route| replace:: The |resource route| resource is used to manage the system routing table in a |linux| environment.
.. |resource desc ruby_block| replace:: The |resource ruby block| resource is used to execute |ruby| code during a |chef| run. |ruby| code in the ``ruby_block`` resource is evaluated with other resources during convergence, whereas |ruby| code outside of a ``ruby_block`` resource is evaluated before other resources, as the recipe is compiled.
.. |resource desc scm| replace:: The |resource scm| resource is used to manage source control resources that exist in a |git| repository or a |svn| repository.
.. |resource desc script| replace:: The |resource script| resource is used to execute using the specified interpreter (|bash|, |csh|, |perl|, |python|, or |ruby|). This resource includes all of the actions and attributes that are available to the |resource execute| resource. The |ruby| script resource is different from the |resource ruby block| resource because |ruby| run with the |resource script| resource is created as a temporary file and executed like other script resources, rather than run inline. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` meta parameters to guard the use of this resource for idempotence.
.. |resource desc service| replace:: The |resource service| resource is used to manage a service.
.. |resource desc template| replace:: The |resource template| resource is used to manage file contents with an embedded |ruby| (erb) template. This resource includes actions and attributes from the |resource file| resource. Templates follow the same file specificity rules as the |resource remote file| and |resource file| resources.
.. |resource desc user| replace:: The |resource user| resource is used to manage a local user.
.. |resource desc yum| replace:: The |resource yum package| resource is used to use |yum| for installation, upgrade, and removal of packages. This resource is able to resolve provides data for packages much like |yum| can do when running it from the command line. This allows a variety of options for installing packages, like minimum versions, virtual provides, and library names.

For example: ``rights <permissions>, <principal>, <options>`` where ``<permissions> is specifies the rights granted to the principal, ``<principal>`` is the group or user name, and ``<options``> is a hash with one (or more) advanced rights options.

For example: ``rights <permissions>, <principal>, <options>`` where ``<permissions> is specifies the rights granted to the principal, ``<principal>`` is the group or user name, and ``<options``> is a hash with one (or more) advanced rights options.
.. |rights resource template| replace:: |windows| only. The permissions for users and groups in a |windows| environment. For example: ``rights <permissions>, <principal>, <options>`` where ``<permissions> is specifies the rights granted to the principal, ``<principal>`` is the group or user name, and ``<options``> is a hash with one (or more) advanced rights options.
