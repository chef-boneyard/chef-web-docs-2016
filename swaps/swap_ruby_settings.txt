.. |log_location| replace:: The location in which log file output files will be saved. If this location is set to something other than ``STDOUT``, standard output logging will still be performed (otherwise there would be no output other than to a file). Default value: ``STDOUT``.


.. M -- EDITED

.. |max_attachment_chunk_size| replace:: The maximum attachment size.
.. |max_dbs_open| replace:: The maximum number of open databases.

.. P -- EDITED
.. 


.. |port couch db| replace:: The port on which |couch db| will listen.
.. |primary drbd| replace:: The fully qualified domain name, IP address, and port number for the |drbd| primary node. In a high-availability topology, this value is typically set automatically based on server entries on the back-end role.

.. Q -- EDITED
.. 




.. R -- EDITED
.. 


.. |reduce_limit| replace:: Indicates whether |couch db| limits the number of reduce functions.




.. S -- EDITED
..

.. |service_order| replace:: The order in which |keepalived| will start and stop services when transitioning from a primary to a backup. The default order is the recommended (and supported) order; changing this setting may make it difficult for |opscode| to troubleshoot issues that may arise with a high availability cluster.
.. |shared_secret| replace:: The shared secret using during peer authentication. This value is randomly generated ("when the bootstrap server is installed" jamescott: WHICH BOOTSTRAP SERVER? THE PART IN "QUOTES" SHOULD EITHER BE MADE MORE SPECIFICALLY CLEAR OR REMOVED.) and should never be set explicitly.

.. |smtp_connect_timeout| replace:: The amount of time (in seconds) the service will wait for an SMTP connection.
.. |smtp_server| replace:: The IP address of the SMTP server to which service will connect.






.. |sync_rate| replace:: The amount of bandwidth allocated for background synchronization. This value is often set at around 30% of the bandwidth available to foreground synchronization. jamescott: remove this after review: http://www.drbd.org/users-guide/s-configure-sync-rate.html

.. T -- EDITED

.. |version drbd| replace:: The version of |drbd| installed on the system. This value is auto-detected.

.. |vrrp_instance_advert_int| replace:: The frequency (in seconds) at which the primary server will advertise.
.. |vrrp_instance_interface| replace:: The interface over which VRRP traffic is sent. On systems with a dedicated interface for |keepalived| traffic, this should be set to the name of the dedicated interface.
.. |vrrp_instance_ipaddress| replace:: The virtual IP address that is to be managed. This is often a virtual IP address that is shared by all of the back end servers.
.. |vrrp_instance_ipaddress_dev| replace:: The device to which a virtual IP address is added.
.. |vrrp_instance_password| replace:: The secret key for VRRP pairs. This value is randomly generated ("when the bootstrap is installed" jamescott: WHICH BOOTSTRAP SERVER? THE PART IN "QUOTES" SHOULD EITHER BE MADE MORE SPECIFICALLY CLEAR OR REMOVED.) and should never be set explicitly.
.. |vrrp_instance_priority| replace:: The priority for this server. The server which has the lowest priority will be the primary server. By default, all servers have equal priority, which means the cluster will have no preference for one server over another.
.. |vrrp_instance_state| replace:: The default VRRP state for the server. This state should be the same on all servers in the back end.
.. |vrrp_instance_virtual_router_id| replace:: The virtual router ID for the |keepalived| pair. This should be a unique ID within the multicast domain being used with |keepalived|.
.. |vrrp_unicast_bind| replace:: The unicast cluster IP address that |keepalived| binds to when talking to its peer. This value should be undefined in order to use multicast. This value is configured automatically based on settings derived from the |path chef private etc| file. The default order is the recommended (and supported) order; changing this setting may make it difficult for |opscode| to troubleshoot issues that may arise with a high availability cluster.
.. |vrrp_unicast_peer| replace:: The unicast cluster IP address that |keepalived| sends to when talking to its peer. This value should be undefined in order to use multicast. This value is configured automatically based on settings derived from the |path chef private etc| file.
