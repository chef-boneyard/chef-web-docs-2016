.. Notes that are used across the docs.

.. |note xxxxx| replace:: xxxxx                                                  

.. Note strings used in Chef Documentation
..

.. |note api chef server manage clients with knife| replace:: In general, the |chef api client| list should be managed using |knife| or the |chef server| management console, as opposed to the |api chef server|.

.. |note api cookbooks site using knife| replace:: In general, using |knife| (and the ``knife cookbook site`` sub-command) to manage cookbooks that are located on the Cookbooks site is more efficient than using the |api cookbooks site|. Using |knife| to manage cookbooks that are located on the Cookbooks site is recommended. This document provides information about the |api cookbooks site| in the event that using the API is necessary.

.. |note cookbook template erubis| replace:: |chef| uses |erubis| for templates, which is a fast, secure, and extensible implementation of embedded |ruby|. |erubis| should be familiar to members of the |ruby on rails|, |merb|, or |puppet| communities. For more information about |erubis|, see: |http erubis main|.      

.. |note env resource variable on unix| replace:: On |unix|-based systems, the best way to manipulate environment keys is with the ENV variable in |ruby|; however, this approach does not have the same "permanent" effect as using the ``env`` resource.

.. |note erlang_call resource must be on path| replace:: The ``erl_call`` command needs to be on the path for this resource to work properly.

.. |note execute resource intepreter| replace:: Use the |resource script| resource to execute a script using a specific interpreter (|ruby|, |python|, |perl|, |csh|, or |bash|).

.. |note file resource use other resources| replace:: Other resources should be used to manage files that are not present on a node. Use |resource cookbook file| when copying a file from a cookbook, |resource template| when using a template, and |resource remote_file| when transferring files from remote locations.

.. |note install trial for hosted| replace:: If you want to install |chef| and try it out without having to install |chef server| on a physical machine, sign up for |chef hosted|: http://www.opscode.com/hosted-chef/. The first five nodes are free of charge. Once you have signed up you can continue with the installation process. You can decide to use another type of |chef server| later if you want to.

.. |note knife quick reference| replace:: The |knife qr| provides an all-in-one quick reference of |knife| commands. View a web-based PNG file here: http://docs.opscode.com/_images/qr_knife_web.png. Or download the source files from here: https://github.com/opscode/quick-reference. Print the front/back source files and laminate them for best effect.

.. |note knife rb windows path| replace:: When running |windows|, the |knife rb| file is located at ``c:\Users\<username>\.chef``. If this path needs to be scripted, use ``%USERPROFILE%\.chef``.

.. |note metadata json| replace:: A |metadata json| file can be edited directly, should temporary changes be required. Any subsequent upload or action that generates metadata will cause the existing |metadata json| file to be overwritten with the newly generated metadata. Therefore, any permanent change to metadata that is required should only be made in the |metadata rb| file.

.. |note registry_key resource recursive| replace:: Be careful when using the ``:delete_key`` action with the ``recursive`` attribute. This will delete the registry key and all of its subkeys and all of the values associated with them. This cannot be undone by |chef|.

.. |note registry_key architecture| replace:: The ``ARCHITECTURE`` attribute should only specify ``:x86_64`` or ``:i386`` when it is necessary to write 32-bit (``:i386``) or 64-bit (``:x86_64``) values on a 64-bit machine. ``ARCHITECTURE`` will default to ``:machine`` unless a specific value is given.

.. |note registry_key not_if only_if| replace:: This method can be used in recipes and from within the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` blocks in resources. This method is not designed to create or modify a registry setting. If a registry setting needs to be modified, use the |resource registry_key| resource.

.. |note remote_file resource fetch from files directory| replace:: Fetching files from the ``files/`` directory in a cookbook should be done with the |resource cookbook file| resource.

.. |note scm resource use with resource deploy| replace:: This resource is often used in conjunction with the |resource deploy| resource.

.. |note yum resource using file names| replace:: Support for using file names to install packages (as in ``yum_package "/bin/sh"``) is not available because the volume of data required to parse for this is excessive.
