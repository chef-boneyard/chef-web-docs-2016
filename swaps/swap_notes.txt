.. Note strings used in Chef Documentation
..

.. |note api chef server manage clients with knife| replace:: The |chef api client| list should be managed using |knife| or the |chef server| management console, as opposed to the |api chef server|.

.. |note api cookbooks site using knife| replace:: In general, using |knife| (and the ``knife cookbook site`` sub-command) to manage cookbooks that are located on the COOKBOOKS SITE is more efficient than using the COOKBOOKS SITE API. Using |knife| to manage cookbooks that are located on the COOKBOOKS SITE is recommended. This document provides information about the COOKBOOKS SITE API in the even that using the API is necessary.

.. |note env resource variable on unix| replace:: On |unix|-based systems, the best way to manipulate environment keys is with the ENV variable in |ruby|; however, this approach does not have the same "permanent" effect as using the ``env`` resource.

.. |note erlang_call resource must be on path| replace:: The ``erl_call`` command needs to be on the path for this resource to work properly.

.. |note execute resource intepreter| replace:: Use the |resource script| resource to execute a script using a specific interpreter (|ruby|, |python|, |perl|, |csh|, or |bash|).

.. |note file resource use other resources| replace:: Other resources should be used to manage files that are not present on a node. Use |resource cookbook file| when copying a file from a cookbook, |resource template| when using a template, and |resource remote file| when transferring files from remote locations.

.. |note remote_file resource fetch from files directory| replace:: Fetching files from the ``files/`` directory in a cookbook should be done with the |resource cookbook file| resource.

.. |note scm resource use with resource deploy| replace:: This resource is often used in conjunction with the |resource deploy| resource.

.. |note yum resource using file names| replace:: Support for using file names to install packages (as in ``yum_package "/bin/sh"``) is not available because the volume of data required to parse for this is excessive.
