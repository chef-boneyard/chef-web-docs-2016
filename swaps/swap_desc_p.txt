This value may also be identified by the uninstaller itself (in the ``Name`` column) and can be viewed while running the uninstaller.
.. |package_name resource package| replace:: The name of the package to install. Default value: ``name``.
.. |package_name resource yum| replace:: One of the following: the name of a package, the name of a package and its architecture; the name of a dependency. Default value: ``name``.

.. |path resource file| replace:: The path to the file. Default value: ``name``.
.. |path resource remote_directory| replace:: The path to the directory. Default value: ``name``.

.. |platform| replace:: The platform for which a cookbook is designed.
.. |platform-version| replace:: The version of the platform.
.. |plugin resource ohai| replace:: Optional. Indicates that only the specified plug-ins are reloaded by |ohai|. Default value: ``nil`` (all plug-ins are reloaded ).

.. |port lwrp firewall_rule| replace:: The port number.

.. |purge cookbook| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook (or cookbook version) will be removed entirely from the |chef server|. This action should be used carefully because only one copy of any single file is stored on the |chef server|. Consequently, purging a cookbook will disable any other cookbook that references one or more files from a cookbook that has been purged.
.. |purge node hp| replace:: Indicates that all corresponding nodes on the |chef server| will be destroyed, in addition to the |hp cloud| node itself. This option (by itself) assumes that the node and client have the same name as the server. If they do not, use the ``--node-name`` option to specify the correct name for the node.
.. |purge node rackspace| replace:: Indicates that all corresponding nodes on the |chef server| will be destroyed, in addition to the |rackspace| node itself. This option (by itself) assumes that the node and client have the same name as the server. If they do not, use the ``--node-name`` option to specify the correct name for the node.
