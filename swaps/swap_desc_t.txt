.. Description strings that begin with the letter T.
.. The pattern is |txxxx| replace:: string.
.. 
.. 

.. T
.. 

.. |tags| replace:: The tags for this server.
.. |tags list| replace:: A list of tags that will be displayed in the output.
.. |target resource ifconfig| replace:: The network address that will be assigned to the network interface. Default value: ``name``.
.. |target_file resource link| replace:: The name of the link. Default value: ``name``.
.. |target resource route| replace:: The address of the target route. Default value: ``name``.

.. |tcp-endpoints| replace:: A comma-separated list of local and public TCP ports that will be opened, for example: ``80:80,433:5000``.

.. |template-file| replace:: The path to a template file that will be used during a bootstrap operation. Do not use the ``--distro`` option when ``--template-file`` is specified.
.. |template lwrp daemontools_service| replace:: The name variable for the template files. The run script is set up by a template named ``sv-NAME-run.erb``. The log/run script is set up by a template named ``sv-NAME-log-run.erb``. The finish script is set up by a template named ``sv-NAME-finish.erb``. For each of these scripts, the ``NAME`` placeholder will be replaced by the value specified for this attribute. These templates should be located in the directory of a cookbook that uses this lightweight resource. Default value: ``NAME``.
.. |terremark-password| replace:: The password for the |terremark| service.
.. |terremark-service| replace:: The name of the |terremark| service.
.. |terremark-username| replace:: A user name with permission to access a |terremark| service.

.. |timeout lwrp aws_ebs_volume| replace:: The connection timeout for the |amazon ec2| API. Default value: ``3 minutes``.
.. |timeout lwrp aws_elastic_ip| replace:: The amount of time before the |amazon ec2| API will time out. Default value: ``3 minutes``.
.. |timeout lwrp name_of_resource| replace:: The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for ring convergence. Default value: ``30``.
.. |timeout resource execute| replace:: The amount of time (in seconds) the command will wait before timing out. Default value: ``3600``.
.. |timestamped_deploy provider deploy| replace:: The ``timestamped_deploy`` provider is the default |resource deploy| provider. It is used to name release directories with a timestamp in the form of ``YYYYMMDDHHMMSS``. For example: ``/my/deploy/dir/releases/20121120162342``. The |resource deploy| resource will determine whether or not to deploy code based on the existence of the release directory in which it is attempting to deploy. Because the timestamp is different for every |chef| run, the ``timestamped_deploy`` provider is not idempotent. When the ``timestamped_deploy`` provider is used, it will require managing the action setting on the resource manually in order to prevent unintended continuous deployment.

.. |to resource link| replace:: The actual file to which the link will be created.
.. |torrent lwrp transmission_torrent_file| replace:: A URI or a local path that specifies a file in a |bittorrent| swarm that will be joined.

.. |ttl lwrp dynect_rr| replace:: The record time to live.

.. |type lwrp djbdns_rr| replace:: The type of record: ``ns``, ``childns``, ``host``, ``alias``, or ``mx``. Default value: ``host``.
