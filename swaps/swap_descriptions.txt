.. |local_template| replace:: Use to load a template from a local path. By default, the |chef client| loads templates from a cookbook's ``/templates`` directory. When this attribute is set to ``true``, use the ``source`` attribute specify the path to a template on the local node.
.. |localpkg_gpgcheck| replace:: Indicates whether |yum| should perform a |gnu pg| signature check on local packages.
.. |lockfile| replace:: A lock used by the |chef client| to ensure that only one instance of |chef client| or |chef solo| is modifying the system at any time. By default, the lock file is located in the ``file_cache_path`` so that intentional uses of multiple instances work automatically. If ``file_cache_path`` is located on an NF mount a different location for the lock file is recommended.
.. |logfile_yum| replace:: The full directory and file name for the location in which |yum| should write a log file.
.. |log_level| replace:: The level of logging that will be stored in a log file.
.. |log_location| replace:: The location in which log file output files will be saved. If this location is set to something other than ``STDOUT``, standard output logging will still be performed (otherwise there would be no output other than to a file).
.. |log_rotation| replace:: Use to define the log rotation policy for this service. Log files are rotated when they exceed ``file_maxbytes``. The maximum number of log files in the rotation is defined by ``num_to_keep``.
.. |long| replace:: Display long output when searching nodes while using the default summary format.
.. |long description| replace:: A longer description that ideally contains full instructions on the proper use of a cookbook, including definitions, libraries, dependencies, and so on. There are two ways to use this field: with the contents embedded in the field itself or with the contents pulled from a file at a specified path, such as a README.rdoc located at the top of a cookbook directory.

.. The pattern is |mxxxx| replace:: string.
.. 
.. 

.. M
.. 


.. |maintainer| replace:: The name of the person responsible for maintaining a cookbook, either an individual or an organization.
.. |maintainer email| replace:: The email address for the person responsible for maintaining a cookbook. Only one email can be listed here, so if this needs to be forwarded to multiple people consider using an email address that is already setup for mail forwarding.
.. |manage_symlink_source| replace:: Indicates that the |chef client| will detect and manage the source file for a symlink.
.. |manual_list| replace:: Indicates that a search query is a space-separated list of servers.

.. |memory maximum_redis| replace:: The maximum amount of memory (in bytes).
.. |memory maximum_policy_redis| replace:: The policy applied when the maximum amount of memory is reached. Possible values: ``allkeys-lru`` (remove keys, starting with those used least frequently), ``allkeys-random`` (remove keys randomly), ``noeviction`` (don't expire, return an error on write operation), ``volatile-lru`` (remove expired keys, starting with those used least frequently), ``volatile-random`` (remove expired keys randomly), and ``volatile-ttl`` (remove keys, starting with nearest expired time).

.. |metadata_expire| replace:: The amount of time (in seconds) before metadata for this repository expires.
.. |metadata rb conflicts| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook conflicts with another cookbook or cookbook version. Use a version constraint to define constraints for cookbook versions: ``<`` (less than), ``<=`` (less than or equal to), ``=`` (equal to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), ``~>`` (approximately greater than), or ``>`` (greater than). This field requires that a cookbook with a matching name and version does not exist on the |chef server|. When the match exists, the |chef server| will ensure that any conflicted cookbooks are not included with the set of cookbooks that are sent to the node when the |chef client| runs.
.. |metadata rb depends| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook has a dependency on another cookbook. Use a version constraint to define dependencies for cookbook versions: ``<`` (|ruby less|), ``<=`` (|ruby less_or_equal|), ``=`` (|ruby equal|), ``>=`` (|ruby greater_optimistic|), ``~>`` (|ruby greater_pessimistic|), or ``>`` (|ruby greater|). This field requires that a cookbook with a matching name and version exists on the |chef server|. When the match exists, the |chef server| will include the dependency as part of the set of cookbooks that are sent to the node when the |chef client| runs. It is very important that the ``depends`` field contain accurate data. If a dependency statement is inaccurate, the |chef client| may not be able to complete the configuration of the system.
.. |metadata rb provides| replace:: Adds a recipe, definition, or resource that is provided by this cookbook, should the auto-populated list be insufficient.
.. |metadata rb recommends| replace:: Adds a dependency on another cookbook that is recommended, but not required. A cookbook will still work even if recommended dependencies are not available.

.. |metadata rb suggests| replace:: Adds a dependency on another cookbook that is suggested, but not required. This field is weaker than ``recommends``; a cookbook will still work even when suggested dependencies are not available.
.. |metadata rb supports| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook has a supported platform. Use a version constraint to define dependencies for platform versions: ``<`` (less than), ``<=`` (less than or equal to), ``=`` (equal to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), ``~>`` (approximately greater than), or ``>`` (greater than). To specify more than one platform, use more than one ``supports`` field, once for each platform.

.. |mod_urlrewrite| replace:: Use to install support for URL rewrite rules using rule templates, rewrite maps, and |microsoft dotnet| providers.
.. |mode lacp| replace:: The Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) mode. Possible values: ``active`` (active mode), ``disable`` (not used), or ``passive`` (passive mode).
.. |mode resource_directory| replace:: The octal mode for a directory. If ``mode`` is not specified and if the directory already exists, the existing mode on the directory is used. If ``mode`` is not specified, the directory does not exist, and the ``:create`` action is specified, the |chef client| will assume a mask value of ``0777`` and then apply the umask for the system on which the directory will be created to the ``mask`` value. For example, if the umask on a system is ``022``, the |chef client| would use the default value of ``0755``.
.. |mode resource_directory_11-4| replace:: The octal mode for a directory. If ``mode`` is not specified and if the directory already exists, the existing mode on the directory is used. If ``mode`` is not specified, the directory does not exist, and the ``:create`` action is specified, the |chef client| will assume a mask value of ``0777`` and then apply the umask for the system on which the directory will be created to the ``mask`` value. For example, if the umask on a system is ``022``, the |chef client| would use the default value of ``0755``.
.. |mode resource_file| replace:: The octal mode for a file. If ``mode`` is not specified and if the file already exists, the existing mode on the file is used. If ``mode`` is not specified, the file does not exist, and the ``:create`` action is specified, the |chef client| will assume a mask value of ``0777`` and then apply the umask for the system on which the file will be created to the ``mask`` value. For example, if the umask on a system is ``022``, the |chef client| would use the default value of ``0755``.
.. |mode resource_file_11-4| replace:: The octal mode for a file. If ``mode`` is not specified and if the file already exists, the existing mode on the file is used. If ``mode`` is not specified, the file does not exist, and the ``:create`` action is specified, the |chef client| will assume a mask value of ``0777`` and then apply the umask for the system on which the file will be created to the ``mask`` value. For example, if the umask on a system is ``022``, the |chef client| would use the default value of ``0755``.
.. |mode *nix| replace:: The octal mode that is passed to |chmod|. If the value is specified as a quoted string, it will work exactly as if the ``chmod`` command was passed. If the value is specified as an integer, prepend a zero (``0``) to the value to ensure it is interpreted as an octal number. For example, to assign read, write, and execute rights for all users, use ``0777`` or ``'777'``; for the same rights, plus the sticky bit, use ``01777`` or ``'1777'``.
.. |mode windows security| replace:: The octal mode that is translated into rights for |windows| security. Values up to ``0777`` are allowed (no sticky bits) and mean the same in |windows| as they do in |unix|, where ``4`` equals ``GENERIC_READ``, ``2`` equals ``GENERIC_WRITE``, and ``1`` equals ``GENERIC_EXECUTE``. This attribute cannot be used to set ``:full_control``. This attribute has no effect if not specified, but when this attribute and ``rights`` are both specified, the effects will be cumulative.
.. |month cron| replace:: The month in the year on which a |cron| entry should run (1 - 12).
.. |mount_point| replace:: The directory (or path) in which the device should be mounted.
.. |multilib_policy| replace:: Use to install all possible architectures for any package or only the best architecture for the platform. Possible values: ``all`` or ``best``.
