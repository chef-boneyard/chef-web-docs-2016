.. L -- EDITED
.. 

.. |latest| replace:: Indicates that the most recent version of a cookbook will be downloaded.

Use a version constraint to define constraints for cookbook versions: ``<`` (less than), ``<=`` (less than or equal to), ``=`` (equal to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), ``~>`` (approximately greater than), or ``>`` (greater than).  This field requires that a cookbook with a matching name and version exist on the |chef server|. When the match exists, the |chef server| will ensure that conflicted cookbook is not included with the set of cookbooks that are sent to the node when the |chef client| runs. **jamescott: wild-ass guess based on the seeming parallelism of the ``depends`` field.**
.. |metadata rb depends| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook has a dependency on another cookbook or cookbook version. Use a version constraint to define dependencies for cookbook versions: ``<`` (less than), ``<=`` (less than or equal to), ``=`` (equal to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), ``~>`` (approximately greater than), or ``>`` (greater than). This field requires that a cookbook with a matching name and version exist on the |chef server|. When the match exists, the |chef server| will include the dependency as part of the set of cookbooks that are sent to the node when the |chef client| runs. This field should be used whenever a feature that is included in another cookbook should be run when this cookbook is run, such as including recipes, using the same resources or providers in lightweight resource providers, custom libraries, or definitions. It is very important that the ``depends`` field contain accurate data. If a dependency statement is inaccurate, |chef| may not be able to complete the configuration of the system.
.. |metadata rb provides| replace:: Adds a recipe, definition, or resource that is provided by this cookbook, should the auto-populated list be insufficient.
.. |metadata rb recommends| replace:: Adds a dependency on another cookbook that is recommended, but not required. A cookbook will still work even if recommended dependencies are not available.
.. |metadata rb replaces| replace:: Indicates that this cookbook should replace another (and can be used in-place of that cookbook).
.. |metadata rb suggests| replace:: Adds a dependency on another cookbook that is suggested, but not required. This field is weaker than ``recommends``; a cookbook will still work even when suggested dependencies are not available.
.. |metadata rb supports| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook has a supported platform. Use a version constraint to define dependencies for platform versions: ``<`` (less than), ``<=`` (less than or equal to), ``=`` (equal to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), ``~>`` (approximately greater than), or ``>`` (greater than). To specify more than one platform, use more than one ``supports`` field, once for each platform.

.. |purge amazon ec2| replace:: Indicates that all corresponding nodes and clients on the |chef server| will be destroyed, in addition to the |amazon ec2| node itself. This action (by itself) assumes that the node and client have the same name as the server; if they do not have the same names, then the ``--node-name`` option must be used to specify the name of the node.
.. |purge cookbook| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook (or cookbook version) will be removed entirely from the repository and its backup. This action should be used carefully because purging a cookbook will disable any other cookbook that references one or more files from a cookbook that has been purged.
.. |purge node hp| replace:: Indicates that all corresponding nodes on the |chef server| will be destroyed, in addition to the |hp cloud| node itself. This option (by itself) assumes that the node and client have the same name as the server. If they do not, use the ``--node-name`` option to specify the correct name for the node.
.. |purge node rackspace| replace:: Indicates that all corresponding nodes on the |chef server| will be destroyed, in addition to the |rackspace| node itself. This option (by itself) assumes that the node and client have the same name as the server. If they do not, use the ``--node-name`` option to specify the correct name for the node.

.. |purge windows azure| replace:: Indicates that all corresponding nodes and clients on the |chef server| will be destroyed, in addition to the |windows azure| node itself.

.. |ruby dsl description| replace:: A description of the functionality that is covered.
.. |ruby dsl environment run list| replace:: Optional. A list of environments, each specifying a recipe or a role that will be applied to that environment. Each environment in the list may only have a single recipe or role assigned to it. This setting must specify the ``_default`` environment. If the ``_default`` environment is set to ``[]`` or ``nil`` then the run list will be empty. **jamescott: SEE CHEF-2636.**
.. |ruby dsl name| replace:: A unique name within the |chef| organization. Each name must be unique and must be made up of letters (upper- and lower-case), numbers, underscores, and hyphens: [A-Z][a-z][0-9] and [_-]. Spaces are not allowed.
