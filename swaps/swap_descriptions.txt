.. 

.. |maintainer| replace:: The name of the person responsible for maintaining a cookbook, either an individual or an organization.

.. |medium| replace:: Display more, but not all, of a node's data when searching using the default summary format.
.. |metadata attributes| replace:: The list of attributes that are required to configure a cookbook. An attribute name is required, followed by any of these options: ``display_name`` (the name that appears in the user interface), ``description`` (a short description), ``choice`` (an array of choices that are presented to a user), ``calculated`` (indicates if the default value is calculated by the recipe), ``type`` (the type of value, either ``string`` or ``array``), ``required`` (the level of user input, either ``required``, ``recommended``, or ``optional``), ``recipes`` (an array of recipes), and ``default`` (the attribute's default value).
.. |metadata rb conflicts| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook conflicts with another cookbook or cookbook version. Use a version constraint to define constraints for cookbook versions: ``<`` (less than), ``<=`` (less than or equal to), ``=`` (equal to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), ``~>`` (approximately greater than), or ``>`` (greater than).  This field requires that a cookbook with a matching name and version exist on the |chef server|. When the match exists, the |chef server| will ensure that conflicted cookbook is not included with the set of cookbooks that are sent to the node when the |chef client| runs. **jamescott: wild-ass guess based on the seeming parallelism of the ``depends`` field.**
.. |metadata rb depends| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook has a dependency on another cookbook or cookbook version. Use a version constraint to define dependencies for cookbook versions: ``<`` (less than), ``<=`` (less than or equal to), ``=`` (equal to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), ``~>`` (approximately greater than), or ``>`` (greater than). This field requires that a cookbook with a matching name and version exist on the |chef server|. When the match exists, the |chef server| will include the dependency as part of the set of cookbooks that are sent to the node when the |chef client| runs. This field should be used whenever a feature that is included in another cookbook should be run when this cookbook is run, such as including recipes, using the same resources or providers in lightweight resource providers, custom libraries, or definitions. It is very important that the ``depends`` field contain accurate data. If a dependency statement is inaccurate, |chef| may not be able to complete the configuration of the system.
.. |metadata rb provides| replace:: Adds a recipe, definition, or resource that is provided by this cookbook, should the auto-populated list be insufficient.
.. |metadata rb recommends| replace:: Adds a dependency on another cookbook that is recommended, but not required. A cookbook will still work even if recommended dependencies are not available.
.. |metadata rb replaces| replace:: Indicates that this cookbook should replace another (and can be used in-place of that cookbook).
.. |metadata rb suggests| replace:: Adds a dependency on another cookbook that is suggested, but not required. This field is weaker than ``recommends``; a cookbook will still work even when suggested dependencies are not available.
.. |metadata rb supports| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook has a supported platform. Use a version constraint to define dependencies for platform versions: ``<`` (less than), ``<=`` (less than or equal to), ``=`` (equal to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), ``~>`` (approximately greater than), or ``>`` (greater than). To specify more than one platform, use more than one ``supports`` field, once for each platform.

.. |purge amazon ec2| replace:: Indicates that all corresponding nodes and clients on the |chef server| will be destroyed, in addition to the |amazon ec2| node itself. This action (by itself) assumes that the node and client have the same name as the server; if they do not have the same names, then the ``--node-name`` option must be used to specify the name of the node.
.. |purge cookbook| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook (or cookbook version) will be removed entirely from the |chef server|. This action should be used carefully because only one copy of any single file is stored on the |chef server|. Consequently, purging a cookbook will disable any other cookbook that references one or more files from a cookbook that has been purged.
.. |purge node hp| replace:: Indicates that all corresponding nodes on the |chef server| will be destroyed, in addition to the |hp cloud| node itself. This option (by itself) assumes that the node and client have the same name as the server. If they do not, use the ``--node-name`` option to specify the correct name for the node.
.. |purge node rackspace| replace:: Indicates that all corresponding nodes on the |chef server| will be destroyed, in addition to the |rackspace| node itself. This option (by itself) assumes that the node and client have the same name as the server. If they do not, use the ``--node-name`` option to specify the correct name for the node.

.. Q -- EDITED
.. 

.. |query| replace:: Use to protect search queries that start with a hyphen (-). A ``-q`` query may be specified as an argument or an option, but not both.


.. R -- EDITED
..

.. |region openstack| replace:: The name of the region from which instances of hosted applications are launched.
.. |repository| replace:: The path to the |chef| repository.
.. |resource desc cookbook_file| replace:: The |resource cookbook file| resource is used to transfer files from a sub-directory of the ``files/`` directory in a cookbook to a specified path on the host running the |chef client| or |chef solo|. The file in a cookbook is selected according to file specificity, which allows different source files to be used based on the hostname, host platform (operating system, distro, or as appropriate), or platform version. Place files under COOKBOOK_NAME/files/default to use them on any platform.
.. |resource desc cron| replace:: The |resource cron| resource is used to manage |cron| entries for time-based job scheduling. Attributes for a schedule will default to ``*`` of not provided, so only specify scheduling attributes that are applicable to a |cron| entry. The |resource cron| resource requires that a package be installed that provides the |crontab| program, typically |cron|.
.. |resource desc deploy| replace:: The |resource deploy| resource is used to manage and control deployments. There is a large number of attributes available for this resource that can be used to specify many different behaviors. Please review them carefully before deciding on which approach is required for a particular recipe.
.. |resource desc directory| replace:: The |resource directory| resource is used to manage a directory.
.. |resource desc env| replace:: The |resource env| resource is used to manage environment keys in |windows|. After an environment key is set, |windows| must be restarted before the environment key will be available to the |windows task scheduler|.
.. |resource desc erlang_call| replace:: The |resource erlang call| resource is used to connect to a node located within a distributed |erlang| system. An |resource erlang call| resource is not idempotent. Use the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` meta parameters to guard the use of this resource for idempotence.
.. |resource desc execute| replace:: The |resource execute| resource is used to execute a command. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` meta parameters to guard the use of this resource for idempotence.
.. |resource desc file| replace:: The |resource file| resource is used to manage files that are present on a node, including setting or updating the contents of those files.
.. |resource desc group| replace:: The |resource group| resource is used to manage a local group.

.. |resource desc ifconfig| replace:: The |resource ifconfig| resource is used to manage interfaces.
.. |resource desc link| replace:: The |resource link| resource is used to create symbolic or hard links.
.. |resource desc log| replace:: The |resource log| resource is used to create log entries from a recipe.
.. |resource desc mdadm| replace:: The |resource mdadm| resource is used to manage |mdadm| software |raid| devices in a |linux| environment. The |resource mdadm| provider will create and assemble an array, but it will not create the config file that is used to persist the array upon reboot. If the config file is required, it must be done by specifying a template with the correct array layout, and then by using the |resource mount| provider to create a file systems table (fstab) entry.
.. |resource desc mount| replace:: The |resource mount| resource is used to manage a mounted file system.
.. |resource desc ohai| replace:: The |resource ohai| resource is used to re-load the |ohai| configuration on a node. This allows recipes that change system attributes (like adding a user) to refer to those attributes later on during the |chef| run.
.. |resource desc package| replace:: The |resource package| resource is used to manage packages. When the package is installed from a local file (such as |rubygems| |debian dkpg| or |rpm|) the file must be added to the node using the |resource remote file| or |resource cookbook file| resources.
.. |resource desc powershell_script| replace:: The |resource powershell script| resource is used to execute a script using the |windows powershell| interpreter. This resource is used just like the |resource script| resource or the providers for |bash|, |csh|, |perl|, |python|, and |ruby|. The |resource powershell script| resource is similar to those, but with some small tweaks under the covers for the |windows| platform and |windows powershell| interpreter. This resource creates and executes a temporary file (similar to the |resource script| resource), rather than running it inline. This resource includes actions (``:run`` and ``:nothing``; ) and attributes (``creates``, ``cwd``, ``environment``, ``group``, ``path``, ``timeout``, and ``user``) that are available from the |resource execute| resource. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` meta parameters to guard the use of this resource for idempotence.
.. |resource desc remote_directory| replace:: The |resource remote directory| resource is used to recursively transfer a directory from a cookbook's files or default directory. A remote directory will obey file specificity; the directory that will be copied should be located under COOKBOOK_NAME/files/default/REMOTE_DIRECTORY. A host-or distribution-specific path can also be used.
.. |resource desc remote_file| replace:: The |resource remote file| resource is used to transfer a file from a remote location using file specificity. This resource is similar to |resource file|.
.. |resource desc route| replace:: The |resource route| resource is used to manage the system routing table in a |linux| environment.
.. |resource desc ruby_block| replace:: The |resource ruby block| resource is used to execute |ruby| code during a |chef| run. |ruby| code in the ``ruby_block`` resource is evaluated with other resources during convergence, whereas |ruby| code outside of a ``ruby_block`` resource is evaluated before other resources, as the recipe is compiled.
.. |resource desc scm| replace:: The |resource scm| resource is used to manage source control resources that exist in a |git| repository or a |svn| repository.
.. |resource desc script| replace:: The |resource script| resource is used to execute using the specified interpreter (|bash|, |csh|, |perl|, |python|, or |ruby|). This resource includes all of the actions and attributes that are available to the |resource execute| resource. The |ruby| script resource is different from the |resource ruby block| resource because |ruby| run with the |resource script| resource is created as a temporary file and executed like other script resources, rather than run inline. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` meta parameters to guard the use of this resource for idempotence.
.. |resource desc service| replace:: The |resource service| resource is used to manage a service.
.. |resource desc template| replace:: The |resource template| resource is used to manage file contents with an embedded |ruby| (erb) template. This resource includes actions and attributes from the |resource file| resource. Templates follow the same file specificity rules as the |resource remote file| and |resource file| resources.
.. |resource desc user| replace:: The |resource user| resource is used to manage a local user.
.. |resource desc yum| replace:: The |resource yum package| resource is used to use |yum| for installation, upgrade, and removal of packages. This resource is able to resolve provides data for packages much like |yum| can do when running it from the command line. This allows a variety of options for installing packages, like minimum versions, virtual provides, and library names.

.. |ruby dsl default attribute| replace:: Optional. A set of attributes that should be applied to all nodes, assuming the node does not already have a value for the attribute. This is useful for setting global defaults that can then be overridden for specific nodes. If more than one role attempts to set a default value for the same attribute, the last role applied will win. When nested attributes are present, they will be preserved.
.. |ruby dsl description| replace:: A description of the functionality that is covered.
.. |ruby dsl environment run list| replace:: Optional. A list of environments, each specifying a recipe or a role that will be applied to that environment. Each environment in the list may only have a single recipe or role assigned to it. This setting must specify the ``_default`` environment.

.. |ruby dsl name| replace:: A unique name within the |chef| organization. Each name must be unique and must be made up of letters (upper- and lower-case), numbers, underscores, and hyphens: [A-Z][a-z][0-9] and [_-]. Spaces are not allowed.
.. |ruby dsl override attribute| replace:: Optional. A set of attributes that should be applied to all nodes, even if the node already has a value for an attribute. This is useful for ensuring that certain attributes always have specific values. If more than one role attempts to set an override value for the same attribute, the last role applied will win. When nested attributes are present, they will be preserved.
.. |ruby dsl run list| replace:: A list of recipes and/or roles that will be applied **and** the order in which those recipes and/or roles will be applied.
