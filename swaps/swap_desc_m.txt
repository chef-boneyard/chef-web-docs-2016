.. |mailto resource cron| replace:: Sets the MAILTO environment variable.
.. |maintainer| replace:: The name of the person responsible for maintaining a cookbook, either an individual or an organization.
.. |maintainer email| replace:: The email address for the person responsible for maintaining a cookbook. Only one email can be listed here, so if this needs to be forwarded to multiple people consider using an email address that is already setup for mail forwarding.
.. |manual-list| replace:: Indicates that a search query is a space-separated list of servers.
.. |max_requests lwrp application_python_gunicorn| replace:: The maximum number of request a worker will process before restarting.
.. |mask resource ifconfig| replace:: The netmask for the network interface. Default value: ``nil``.
.. |max_proc lwrp iis_pool| replace:: The maximum number of worker processes available to service requests to an application pool.

.. |media location| replace:: The geographic location for a virtual machine and its services.
.. |medium| replace:: Display more, but not all, of a node's data when searching using the default summary format.
.. |members resource group| replace:: Indicates that users are included in the group. Default value: ``nil``.
.. |memory mb| replace:: The amount of memory, in megabytes. Possible values: ``512``, ``1024``, ``1536``, ``2048``, ``4096``, ``8192``, ``12288``, or ``16384``.

.. |message resource http_request| replace:: The message that is sent by the HTTP request. Default value: ``name``.
.. |message resource log| replace:: The message to be added to a log file.
.. |metadata attributes| replace:: The list of attributes that are required to configure a cookbook. An attribute name is required, followed by any of these options: ``display_name`` (the name that appears in the user interface), ``description`` (a short description), ``choice`` (an array of choices that are presented to a user), ``calculated`` (indicates if the default value is calculated by the recipe), ``type`` (the type of value, either ``string`` or ``array``), ``required`` (the level of user input, either ``required``,``recommended``, or ``optional``), ``recipes`` (an array of recipes), or ``default`` (the attribute's default value).
.. |metadata rb conflicts| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook conflicts with another cookbook or cookbook version. Use a version constraint to define constraints for cookbook versions: ``<`` (less than), ``<=`` (less than or equal to), ``=`` (equal to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), ``~>`` (approximately greater than), or ``>`` (greater than).  This field requires that a cookbook with a matching name and version exist on the |chef server|. When the match exists, the |chef server| will ensure that any conflicted cookbooks are not included with the set of cookbooks that are sent to the node when the |chef client| runs.
.. |metadata rb depends| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook has a dependency on another cookbook. Use a version constraint to define dependencies for cookbook versions: ``<`` (less than), ``<=`` (less than or equal to), ``=`` (equal to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), ``~>`` (approximately greater than), or ``>`` (greater than). This field requires that a cookbook with a matching name and version exists on the |chef server|. When the match exists, the |chef server| will include the dependency as part of the set of cookbooks that are sent to the node when the |chef client| runs. It is very important that the ``depends`` field contain accurate data. If a dependency statement is inaccurate, |chef| may not be able to complete the configuration of the system.
.. |metadata rb provides| replace:: Adds a recipe, definition, or resource that is provided by this cookbook, should the auto-populated list be insufficient.
.. |metadata rb recommends| replace:: Adds a dependency on another cookbook that is recommended, but not required. A cookbook will still work even if recommended dependencies are not available.
.. |metadata rb replaces| replace:: Indicates that this cookbook should replace another (and can be used in-place of that cookbook).
.. |metadata rb suggests| replace:: Adds a dependency on another cookbook that is suggested, but not required. This field is weaker than ``recommends``; a cookbook will still work even when suggested dependencies are not available.
.. |metadata rb supports| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook has a supported platform. Use a version constraint to define dependencies for platform versions: ``<`` (less than), ``<=`` (less than or equal to), ``=`` (equal to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), ``~>`` (approximately greater than), or ``>`` (greater than). To specify more than one platform, use more than one ``supports`` field, once for each platform.
.. |method request type| replace:: The request method: ``DELETE``, ``GET``, ``POST``, or ``PUT``. Default value: ``GET``.
.. |metric resource ifconfig| replace:: The routing metric for the interface. Default value: ``nil``.

.. |migrate lwrp application| replace:: Indicates that the migration command will be run.
.. |migrate resource deploy| replace:: Indicates that the migration command will be run. Default value: ``false``.
.. |migration_command lwrp application| replace:: A string that contains a shell command that can be executed to run a migration operation.
.. |migration_command resource deploy| replace:: A string that contains a shell command that can be executed to run a migration operation.
.. |minute resource cron| replace:: The minute at which the |cron| entry should run (0 - 59). Default value: ``*``.
.. |mirrorlist| replace:: A string that contains the URI to the mirror list, starting with ``http://``, ``ftp://``, or ``file://``. Use ``file://`` if the mirror list is a text file or resides on the local system.

.. |mod_aspnet| replace:: Use to install |microsoft aspdotnet| runtime components.
.. |mod_auth_basic| replace:: Use to install support for basic authentication.
.. |mod_auth_windows| replace:: Use to install |windows| authentication, which allows clients to authenticate using |kerberos| or |ntlm|.
.. |mod_compress_dynamic| replace:: Use to install dynamic content compression support. Enabling dynamic compression allows a more efficient use of bandwidth; however, if the server's processor utilization is already high, the CPU load imposed by dynamic compression may affect site performance.
.. |mod_compress_static| replace:: Use to install support for static content compression.
.. |mod_deploy| replace:: Use to install the |microsoft web deployment tool|, which simplifies the migration, management, and deployment of |microsoft iis| web servers, applications, and websites.
.. |mod_iis6_metabase_compat| replace:: Use to install |microsoft iis| the metabase compatibility component.
.. |mod_isapi| replace:: Use to install extension and filter support for |microsoft isapi|.
.. |mod_logging| replace:: Use to install and enable HTTP logging for website activity, logging tools, and custom logging (for HTTP request/response headers, |microsoft iis| server variables, and client-side fields with simple configuration).
.. |mod_management| replace:: Use to install the management console, which can be used to support the management of local and remote web servers.
.. |mod_mvc3| replace:: Use to install |microsoft dotnet| MVC3 runtime components.
.. |mod_security| replace:: Use to install URL authorization (which authorizes client access to the URLs that comprise a web application), request filtering (which configures rules to block selected client requests), and IP security (which allows or denies access to content based on an IP address or a domain name).
.. |mod_tracing| replace:: Use to install support for tracing |microsoft aspdotnet| applications and failed requests.
.. |mod_urlrewrite| replace:: Use to install support for URL rewrite rules using rule templates, rewrite maps, and |microsoft dotnet| providers.

.. |mode lwrp maven| replace:: An integer value for file permissions. Default value: ``0644``.
.. |mode windows security| replace:: The octal mode of the file that is translated into rights for |windows| security. Values up to ``0777`` are allowed (no sticky bits) and mean the same in |windows| as they do in |unix|, where ``4`` equals ``GENERIC_READ``, ``2`` equals ``GENERIC_WRITE``, and ``1`` equals ``GENERIC_EXECUTE``. This attribute cannot be used to set ``:full_control``. This attribute has no effect if not specified, but when this attribute and ``rights`` are both specified, the effects will be cumulative.

.. |module_name lwrp iis_module| replace:: The name of the module.
.. |monitor lwrp cloudkick_check| replace:: The identifier of a |cloudkick| monitor, which will be the parent of this |cloudkick| check.
.. |month resource cron| replace:: The month in the year on which the |cron| entry should run (1 - 12). Default value: ``*``.
.. |mount_point resource mount| replace:: The directory (or path) in which the device should be mounted. Default value: ``name``.

.. |mtu resource ifconfig| replace:: The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the network interface. Default value: ``nil``.
