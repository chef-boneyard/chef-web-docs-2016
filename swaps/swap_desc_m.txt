.. Description strings that begin with the letter M.
.. The pattern is |mxxxx| replace:: string.

.. |mailto resource cron| replace:: Sets the MAILTO environment variable.
.. |maintainer| replace:: The name of the person responsible for maintaining a cookbook, either an individual or an organization.
.. |maintainer email| replace:: The email address for the person responsible for maintaining a cookbook. Only one email can be listed here, so if this needs to be forwarded to multiple people consider using an email address that is already setup for mail forwarding.
.. |manual-list| replace:: Indicates that a search query is a space-separated list of servers.
.. |mask resource ifconfig| replace:: The netmask for the network interface. Default value: ``nil``.

.. |media location| replace:: The geographic location for a virtual machine and its services.
.. |medium| replace:: Display more, but not all, of a node's data when searching using the default summary format.
.. |members resource group| replace:: Indicates that users are included in the group. Default value: ``nil``.
.. |message resource http_request| replace:: The message that is sent by the HTTP request. Default value: ``name``.
.. |metadata attributes| replace:: The list of attributes that are required to configure a cookbook. An attribute name is required, followed by any of these options: ``display_name`` (the name that appears in the user interface), ``description`` (a short description), ``choice`` (an array of choices that are presented to a user), ``calculated`` (indicates if the default value is calculated by the recipe), ``type`` (the type of value, either ``string`` or ``array``), ``required`` (the level of user input, either ``required``, ``recommended``, or ``optional``), ``recipes`` (an array of recipes), and ``default`` (the attribute's default value).
.. |metadata rb conflicts| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook conflicts with another cookbook or cookbook version. Use a version constraint to define constraints for cookbook versions: ``<`` (less than), ``<=`` (less than or equal to), ``=`` (equal to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), ``~>`` (approximately greater than), or ``>`` (greater than).  This field requires that a cookbook with a matching name and version exist on the |chef server|. When the match exists, the |chef server| will ensure that conflicted cookbook is not included with the set of cookbooks that are sent to the node when the |chef client| runs.
.. |metadata rb depends| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook has a dependency on another cookbook or cookbook version. Use a version constraint to define dependencies for cookbook versions: ``<`` (less than), ``<=`` (less than or equal to), ``=`` (equal to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), ``~>`` (approximately greater than), or ``>`` (greater than). This field requires that a cookbook with a matching name and version exist on the |chef server|. When the match exists, the |chef server| will include the dependency as part of the set of cookbooks that are sent to the node when the |chef client| runs. This field should be used whenever a feature that is included in another cookbook should be run when this cookbook is run, such as including recipes, using the same resources or providers in lightweight resource providers, custom libraries, or definitions. It is very important that the ``depends`` field contain accurate data. If a dependency statement is inaccurate, |chef| may not be able to complete the configuration of the system.
.. |metadata rb provides| replace:: Adds a recipe, definition, or resource that is provided by this cookbook, should the auto-populated list be insufficient.
.. |metadata rb recommends| replace:: Adds a dependency on another cookbook that is recommended, but not required. A cookbook will still work even if recommended dependencies are not available.
.. |metadata rb replaces| replace:: Indicates that this cookbook should replace another (and can be used in-place of that cookbook).
.. |metadata rb suggests| replace:: Adds a dependency on another cookbook that is suggested, but not required. This field is weaker than ``recommends``; a cookbook will still work even when suggested dependencies are not available.
.. |metadata rb supports| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook has a supported platform. Use a version constraint to define dependencies for platform versions: ``<`` (less than), ``<=`` (less than or equal to), ``=`` (equal to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), ``~>`` (approximately greater than), or ``>`` (greater than). To specify more than one platform, use more than one ``supports`` field, once for each platform.
.. |metric resource ifconfig| replace:: The routing metric for the interface. Default value: ``nil``.

.. |migrate resource deploy| replace:: Indicates that the migration command will be run. Default value: ``false``.
.. |migration_command resource deploy| replace:: A string that contains a shell command that can be executed to run a migration operation.
.. |minute resource cron| replace:: The minute at which the |cron| entry should run (0 - 59). Default value: ``*``.

.. |mode resource cookbook_file| replace:: The octal mode of the file. When specifying ``mode``, the value can be a quoted string ("644"). For a numeric value, it should be five digits ("00644") to ensure that it is correctly parsed by |ruby|. The default value for this attribute varies.
.. |mode resource directory| replace:: The octal mode of the file. When specifying ``mode``, the value can be a quoted string ("644"). For a numeric value, it should be five digits ("00644") to ensure that it is correctly parsed by |ruby|. The default value for this attribute varies.
.. |mode resource file| replace:: The octal mode of the file. When specifying ``mode``, the value can be a quoted string ("644"). For a numeric value, it should be five digits ("00644") to ensure that it is correctly parsed by |ruby|. The default value for this attribute varies.
.. |mode resource remote_file| replace:: The octal mode of the file. When specifying ``mode``, the value can be a quoted string ("644"). For a numeric value, it should be five digits ("00644") to ensure that it is correctly parsed by |ruby|. The default value for this attribute varies.
.. |mode resource template| replace:: The octal mode of the file. When specifying ``mode``, the value can be a quoted string ("644"). For a numeric value, it should be five digits ("00644") to ensure that it is correctly parsed by |ruby|. The default value for this attribute varies.
.. |month resource cron| replace:: The month in the year on which the |cron| entry should run (1 - 12). Default value: ``*``.
.. |mount_point resource mount| replace:: The directory (or path) in which the device should be mounted. Default value: ``name``.

.. |mtu resource ifconfig| replace:: The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the network interface. Default value: ``nil``.
