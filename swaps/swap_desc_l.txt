.. Description strings that begin with the letter L.
.. The pattern is |lxxxx| replace:: string.

.. |latest| replace:: Indicates that the most recent version of a cookbook will be downloaded.
.. |layout create_dirs_before_symlink resource deploy| replace:: Use this layout to create directories that need to exist in the release before the symlink step. For example, in the context of a rails app, ``.gitignore`` may be used to keep tempfiles out of a repository and to prevent the ``tmp/`` directory from being part of checked out code. The symlink step will create a symlink from ``shared/pids`` to ``RELEASE/tmp/pids``. Since this behavior would fail if the ``RELEASE/tmp`` directory did not exist, that directory must be created for the deployment to proceed. It is not necessary to create directories that will be symlinked in the symlink step, such as ``log/``, as these do not rely on the existence of other directories in the release. Directories that already exist will be overwritten. Default value: ``["tmp", "public", "config"]``.
.. |layout purge_before_symlink resource deploy| replace:: Use this layout to remove directories before the production copy from a shared directory is symlinked in. ``purge_before_symlink`` is an array of directories that are removed before symlink setup. Default value: ``["log", "tmp/pids", "public/system"]``.
.. |layout symlink_before_migrate resource deploy| replace:: Use this layout to link required configuration files into place so they can be available during a migration step. ``symlink_before_migrate`` is a hash that maps files in the shared directory to files in the current release. Use ``symlink_before_migrate({})`` or ``symlink_before_migrate nil`` instead of ``symlink_before_migrate {}`` because the ``{}`` is interpreted as a block rather than an empty hash. Default value: ``{"config/database.yml" => "config/database.yml"}``.
.. |layout symlinks resource deploy| replace:: Use this layout to map files and directories during the main symlinking step. ``symlinks`` is a hash that maps files and directories from their locations in the shared directory to locations in the release directory. Default value: ``{"system" => "public/system", "pids" => "tmp/pids", "log" => "log"}``.

.. |level resource log| replace:: The level of logging that |chef| will display. |chef| uses the ``mixlib-log`` (https://github.com/opscode/mixlib-log) to handle logging behavior. Options (in order of priority): ``:debug``, ``:info``, ``:warn``, ``:error``, and ``:fatal``. Default value: ``:info``.
.. |level resource mdadm| replace:: The |raid| level. Default value: ``1``.

.. |license| replace:: The type of license under which a cookbook is distributed: ``apachev2``, ``gplv2``, ``gplv3``, ``mit``, or ``none`` (default). This option will place the appropriate license notice in the pre-created files. Be aware of the licenses for files inside of a cookbook and be sure to follow any restrictions they describe.
.. |link_type resource link| replace:: The type of link: ``:symbolic`` or ``:hard``. Default value: ``symbolic``.
.. |linode-api-key| replace:: The |linode| API key.
.. |linode-datacenter| replace:: The datacenter for the |linode| server.
.. |linode-flavor| replace:: The flavor of the |linode| server.
.. |linode-image| replace:: The image for the |linode| server.
.. |linode-kernel| replace:: The kernel for the |linode| server.
.. |linode-node-name| replace:: The name of the node in the |linode| environment.

.. |load-balancer| replace:: The load balancing application to which a server should be added.
.. |local resource template| replace:: Indicates whether a template is already present on the node. Default value: ``false``.
.. |log lwrp daemontools_service| replace:: Indicates whether a service has a custom logging script. Default value: ``nil``.
.. |log_level| replace:: The level of logging that will be stored in a log file: ``debug``, ``info``, ``warn``, ``error``, or ``fatal``.
.. |log_location| replace:: The location in which log file output files will be saved. If this location is set to something other than ``STDOUT``, standard output logging will still be performed (otherwise there would be no output other than to a file). Default value: ``STDOUT``.
.. |logfile| replace:: The location in which the log file will be located. The default location is ``STDOUT``.
.. |long| replace:: Display long output when searching nodes while using the default summary format.
.. |long description| replace:: A longer description that ideally contains full instructions on the proper use of a cookbook, including definitions, libraries, dependencies, and so on. There are two ways to use this field: with the contents embedded in the field itself or with the contents pulled from a file at a specified path, such as a README.rdoc located at the top of a cookbook directory.
