The ``show-config`` subcommand is used to view the configuration that will be generated by the ``reconfigure`` subcommand. This command is most useful in the early stages of a deployment to ensure that everything is built properly prior to installation.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ delivery-ctl show-config
