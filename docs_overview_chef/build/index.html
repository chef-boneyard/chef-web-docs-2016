<h1>An Overview of Chef<a class="headerlink" href="#an-overview-of-chef" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Chef is a systems and cloud infrastructure automation framework that makes it easy to deploy servers and applications to any physical, virtual, and cloud location, no matter the size of your infrastructure. Chef relies on abstract definitions (known as cookbooks and recipes) that are written in Ruby and are managed like source code. Each definition describes how a specific part of your infrastructure should be built and managed. Chef then applies those definitions to servers and applications, as specified, resulting in a fully automated infrastructure. When a new server comes online, the only thing that Chef needs to know is which cookbooks and recipes to apply.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows the relationships between the various elements of a Chef organization, including the nodes, the server, and the workstations. These elements work together to provide Chef the information and instruction that it needs so that it can do its job.</p>
<img alt="_images/overview_chef_draft.png" src="_images/overview_chef_draft.png" />
<p>Chef is comprised of three main elements: a server, one (or more) nodes, and at least one workstation. The Chef server acts as a hub, ensuring that the right cookbooks are used, that the right policies are being applied, that all of the node objects are up-to-date, and that all of the nodes that will be maintained are registered and known to the Chef server. The workstation is the location from which most of the work happens, including authoring cookbooks, synchronizing with the repository, and uploading certain information to the server. The nodes host the various servers and applications in the cloud or on physical devices; each node contains a chef-client that performs the various infrastructure automation tasks that each node requires.</p>
<p>The following sections discuss these elements (and their various components) in more detail.</p>
<div class="section" id="nodes">
<h2>Nodes<a class="headerlink" href="#nodes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A node is a server or virtual server that is configured to be maintained by a chef-client. A node can be physical or cloud-based. A Chef organization can be comprised of any combination of physical and cloud-based nodes. The chef-client runs on each node and Ohai is used to collect data about the system so that Chef can use it. Each node keeps a cache that contains the most recent node object and all of the cookbooks that are used during configuration of the node.</p>
<p>There are two types of nodes that Chef can manage:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="13%" />
<col width="88%" />

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td><img alt="_images/icon_node_cloud.png" class="first last" src="_images/icon_node_cloud.png" />
</td>
<td>A cloud-based node is hosted in an external cloud-based service, such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, OpenStack, Rackspace, Google Compute Engine, Linode, or Windows Azure. Knife can create instances on these cloud-based services so that Chef can be used to deploy, configure, and maintain those instances.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><img alt="_images/icon_node_physical.png" class="first last" src="_images/icon_node_physical.png" />
</td>
<td>A physical node is typically a server or a virtual machine, but it can be any active device attached to a network that is capable of sending, receiving, and forwarding information over a communications channel. In other words, a physical node is a any active device attached to a network that can do both of the following: run a chef-client and communicate with a Chef server.</td>

<ul class="last simple">
<li>Building, registering, and authenticating the node with the Chef server</li>
<li>Synchronizing each required cookbook with the local file cache</li>
<li>Compiling the resource collection by loading each of the required cookbooks, including recipes, attributes, and all other dependencies</li>
<li>Taking the appropriate and required actions to configure the node</li>

<td><p class="first">Ohai is a monitoring tool that is used to detect certain properties about the node environment and then report them back to Chef as node attributes. The types of properties Ohai reports on include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Platform details</li>
<li>Networking usage</li>
<li>Memory usage</li>
<li>Processor usage</li>
<li>Kernel data</li>
<li>Host names</li>
<li>Fully qualified domain names</li>
<li>and other configuration details</li>
</ul>
<p class="last">Ohai reports each piece of data back to the Chef server as a node attribute. Later, while Chef configures a node, these attributes are used to ensure that certain properties remain unchanged. Ohai is part of the required configuration on each node that is registered with the Chef server.</p>

<tr class="row-even"><td><img alt="_images/icon_node_object.png" class="first last" src="_images/icon_node_object.png" />
</td>
<td>For Chef, two important aspects of nodes are groups of attributes and run-lists. An attribute is a specific piece of data about the node, such as a network interface, a file system, or the number of clients that may be accepted. A run-list is an ordered list of recipes and/or roles that are run in an exact order. The run-list and node attributes comprise the node object, which is a JSON file that is stored on the Chef server and cached locally on every node by the chef-client. The chef-client ensures that the locally cached node object is up-do-date at the beginning of every Chef run and then uses the data stored in the node object while it brings the system to the desired state.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Other sub-elements of nodes include exception and report handlers, certificates, and attributes. An exception handler is triggered when a defined aspect of a Chef run fails; a report handler is triggered when a defined aspect succeeds. An SSL certificate handshake is used between the chef-client and the Chef server to prevent a node from accessing data that it shouldn&#8217;t. Attributes can be specified in cookbooks that override the default attributes that are present on the node.</p>

<div class="section" id="workstations">
<h2>Workstations<a class="headerlink" href="#workstations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The workstation is a computer that is configured to run Knife, synchronize with the Chef repository, and to interact with a single Chef server. All of the most important details needed by Chef&#8212;cookbooks and recipes, role and environment data, important settings&#8212;are stored in the Chef repository using version source control. The workstation is the location from which most users of Chef will do most of their work, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Developing cookbooks and recipes (and authoring them using Ruby)</li>
<li>Keeping the Chef repository synchronized with version source control</li>
<li>Using Knife to upload items from the Chef repository to the Chef server</li>

</ul>
<p>The repository is synchronized with a workstation. The Chef repository should be synchronized with a version control system, such as git, and then treated like source code.</p>
<p>The Chef repository is made available from github. It can be cloned from github or downloaded as a tar.gz file (and then associated with another version source control system, such as Subversion, Mercurial, or Bazaar).</p>

<p>Chef assumes that system administrators and developers know best about how the infrastructure should be put together. Chef makes as few decisions on its own as possible. When a decision must be made, Chef uses a reasonable default setting that can be easily changed by the system administrators and developers, most often by defining attributes in cookbooks that take precedence over the default attributes present on nodes.</p>

<h2>Chef Server<a class="headerlink" href="#chef-server" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Chef server acts as a hub, ensuring that the right cookbooks are used, that the right policies are being applied, that all of the node objects are up-to-date, and that all of the nodes that will be maintained are registered and known to the Chef server. The Chef server distributes configuration details (such as recipes, templates, and file distributions) to every node within the organization. Chef then does as much of the configuration work as possible on the nodes themselves (and not on the Chef server). This scalable approach distributes the configuration effort throughout the organization.</p>

<p class="last">Hosted Chef is based on the idea that an infrastructure management tool should be built around a collection of API primitives. By using an API to talk to a cloud provider (such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, Windows Azure, or Rackspace), it allows the freedom to think of those primitives as building blocks. Chef only needs to know about the desired state, how it should get there, and what the proper functionality of that desired state should be.</p>

<h3>Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Policy settings can be used to map the capabilities of Chef to organizational requirements. For example, custom environments can be mapped to an organization&#8217;s actual processes and workflow. Roles define server types, such as &#8220;web server&#8221; or &#8220;database server&#8221;. Certain types of data, such as passwords, user account data, and other sensitive items can be placed in data bags, which are located in a secure sub-area of Chef that can only be accessed by nodes that have the correct SSL certificates.</p>

<h3>Cookbooks<a class="headerlink" href="#cookbooks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A cookbook is the fundamental unit of distribution across Chef organizations. Each cookbook defines an automation scenario and then contains all of the components that are required to run it, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Attributes that set values on nodes</li>
<li>Definitions that allow the creation of reusable collections of resources</li>
<li>File distributions</li>
<li>Libraries that extend Chef and/or provide helpers to Ruby code</li>
<li>Recipes that specify which resources to manage and the order in which those resources will be applied.</li>
<li>Custom resources and providers</li>
<li>Templates</li>
<li>Metadata about recipes (including dependencies), version constraints, supported platforms, and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>Chef uses Ruby as its reference language for creating cookbooks and defining recipes, with an extended DSL for specific resources. Chef provides a reasonable set of resources, enough to support many of the most common infrastructure automation scenarios; however, this DSL can also be extended when additional resources and capabilities are required.</p>

A version may exist for many reasons, such as for ensuring that the correct versions of third-party components are being used or to provide an update to a cookbook that fixes previous issues or adds new improvements. A cookbook version can be defined using syntax and operators, it can be associated with environments, cookbook metadata, or run-lists, and it can be frozen (to prevent unwanted updates from being made). A cookbook version is a cookbook, from the perspective of the repository and how cookbooks are stored on the Chef server and pushed out to one (or more) nodes.</td>

<p>Chef will run a recipe many times on the same system and will create the same system state each time. When a recipe is run against a system, but nothing has changed on either the system or in the recipe, Chef won&#8217;t change anything.</p>
<p>In addition to attributes, recipes, and versions, the following items are also part of cookbooks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Resources. A resource is a package, a service, a group of users, and so on. A resource tells Chef which provider to use during a Chef run for various tasks like installing packages, running Ruby code, or accessing directories and file systems. The resource is generic: &#8220;install program A&#8221; while the provider knows what to do with that process on Debian and Ubuntu and Microsoft Windows. Chef includes default providers that cover all of the most common scenarios.</li>
<li>File distributions. A file distribution is a specific type of resource that tells a cookbook how to distribute files, including by node, by platform, or by file version.</li>
<li>Definitions. A definition is used to create new resources by stringing together one (or more) existing resources.</li>
<li>Libraries. A library allows the use of arbitrary Ruby code in a cookbook, either as a way to extend the Chef language or to implement a new class.</li>
<li>Templates. A template is a file written in markup language that uses Ruby statements to solve complex configuration scenarios.</li>
<li>Configuration files. A metadata file to ensure that each cookbook is correctly deployed to each node.</li>

<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The key underlying principle of Chef is that you (the user) knows best about what your environment is, what it should do, and how it should be maintained. Chef is designed to not make assumptions about any of those things. Only the individuals on the ground&#8212;that&#8217;s you and your team&#8212;understand the technical problems and what is required to solve them. Only the organization&#8212;yours&#8212;understands the human problems (skill levels, audit trails, and other internal issues) that are unique to your organization and whether any single technical solution is viable.</p>
<p>The idea that you know best about what should happen in your environment goes hand-in-hand with the notion that you still need help. It is rare that a single individual knows everything about a very complex problem, let alone knows all of the steps that may be required to solve them. The same is true with tools. Chef provides help with infrastructure management. And Chef can help solve very complicated problems. Chef also has a large community of users who have a lot of experience solving a lot of very complex problems. That Chef community can provide knowledge and support in areas that your organization may not have and (along with Chef) can help your organization solve any complex problem.</p>
