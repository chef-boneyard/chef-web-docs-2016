The |knife rb| file must be created in the |chef repo hidden| folder. It should look similar to:

.. code-block:: ruby

   current_dir = File.dirname(__FILE__)
   log_level                :info
   log_location             STDOUT
   node_name                'node_name'
   client_key               "#{current_dir}/USER.pem"
   validation_client_name   'chef-validator'
   validation_key           "#{current_dir}/ORGANIZATION-validator.pem"
   chef_server_url          'https://api.chef.io/organizations/ORG_NAME'
   cache_type               'BasicFile'
   cache_options( :path => "#{ENV['HOME']}/.chef/checksums" )
   cookbook_path            ["#{current_dir}/../cookbooks"]
