The following example walks through the process of setting up the open source version of |chef server 11| in a virtual machine for the purpose of demoing |chef|. Any type virtual machine software can be used to run the |chef server|; however, this example is based on the following assumptions:

* A computer is running |vmware fusion 5x|
* A virtual machine is configured in |vmware fusion 5x| in which a 64-bit version of |ubuntu| 12.04 is installed
* |ubuntu| is installed with the default configuration (so that it has a very smal footprint in the virtual machine)
* The browser used to access the |chef server| is located on the same computer as the virtual machine
* The URL used to access the |chef server| will include the IP address or |fully qualified domain name| of the virtual machine, e.g. ``https://123.45.6.789``
* A bridged network adapter is all that is required
* The |chef server| is the only application installed on the virtual machine, other than the operating system

The steps below will start with downloading the package for |chef server 11| to the virtual machine. These steps are nearly identical for any installation of |chef server 11| no matter the type of software used to host the virtual machine.
