The |omnibus installer| is used to set up a workstation. The |omnibus installer| uses a single command to install |chef| and all of its dependencies, including an embedded version of |ruby|, |rubygems|, |open ssl|, key-value stores, parsers, libraries, and command line utilities. The |omnibus installer| puts everything into a unique directory (opt/opscode/) so that |chef| will not interfere with other applications that may be running on the target machine. Once installed, |chef| requires a few more configuration steps before it can be run as a workstation.

.. note:: The |omnibus installer| requires that an installation be done as a root user.
