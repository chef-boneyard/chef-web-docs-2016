Each |chef server| in a high availabilty configuration must have an identical |chef server rb| file that is located in the ``/etc/opscode/`` directory on each server. This file describes the topology of the high availability configuration. On the primary backend machine, create a file named |chef server rb| and save it in the ``/etc/opscode/`` directory.

Add the following settings to the |chef server rb| file:

#. Define the topology type:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      topology "ha"

#. Define the primary backend server:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      server "FQDN",
        :ipaddress => "IP_ADDRESS",
        :role => "backend",
        :bootstrap => true,
        :cluster_ipaddress => "CLUSTER_IPADDRESS"

   Replace ``FQDN`` with the |fqdn| of the server and ``IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the server. The role is a backend machine is ``"backend"``. If the backend machine is used to bootstrap the |chef server| installation, replace ``CLUSTER_IPADDRESS`` with the IP address of the interface that is used for cluster communications. For example, the same IP address that is used by |keepalived| and |drbd|. If the |chef server| is not used to bootstrap the |chef server| installation, exclude the ``:cluster_ipaddress`` entry.

#. Define the secondary backend server:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      server "FQDN",
        :ipaddress => "IPADDRESS",
        :role => "backend",
        :cluster_ipaddress => "CLUSTER_IPADDRESS"

   Replace ``FQDN`` with the |fqdn| of the server, and ``IPADDRESS`` with the IP address of the server. Replace ``CLUSTER_IPADDRESS`` with the IP address of the serverâ€™s interface assigned for cluster communications. If no such interface is configured, exclude the ``cluster_ipaddress`` entry.

#. Define the backend virtual IP address:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      backend_vip "FQDN",
        :ipaddress => "IP_ADDRESS",
        :device => "eth0"

   Replace ``FQDN`` with the |fqdn| of the server. Replace ``IP_ADDRESS`` with the virtual IP address of the server. The ``:device`` parameter should be the ethernet interface to which the floater virtual IP address will bind. This is typically the public interface of the server.

#. Define each frontend machine:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      server "FQDN",
        :ipaddress => "IP_ADDRESS",
        :role => "frontend"

   Replace ``FQDN`` with the |fqdn| of the frontend machine. Replace ``IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the frontend machine. Set ``:role`` to ``"frontend"``.

   Add separate entry in the |chef server rb| file for each frontend machine.

#. Define the API |fqdn|:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      api_fqdn "FQDN"

   Replace ``FQDN`` with the |fqdn| of the load balanced virtual IP address, which should be equal to the |fqdn| for the service URI that is used by the |chef server|.
