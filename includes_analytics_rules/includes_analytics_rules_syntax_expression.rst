An expression defines a specific test in a rule and uses fields within the expression that are specific to the message type for the rule. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   total_resource_count > 1 and
   updated_resource_count > 0

.. code-block:: ruby

   array:contains(run_list, 'role[opscode-reporting]')

where both ``total_resource_count``, ``updated_resource_count``, and ``run_list`` are the fields specific to a message type.

See :ref:`analytics_rules_message_fields` for a list of the available
fields for each message type.
