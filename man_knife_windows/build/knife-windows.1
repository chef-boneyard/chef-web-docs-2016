.sp
The \fBwindows\fP sub\-command is used to configure and interact with nodes that exist on server and/or desktop machines that are running Microsoft Windows.

This plugin should be installed using RubyGems.
.sp
This sub\-command has the following syntax when connecting to one (or more) machines that run Microsoft Windows:
.sp
