For example, to get the list of available versions of a cookbook named "getting-started", enter:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife cookbook show getting-started

to return something like:

.. code-block:: bash

   getting-started   0.3.0  0.2.0
   
To show a list of data about a cookbook using the name of the cookbook and the version, enter:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife cookbook show getting-started 0.3.0

to return something like:

.. code-block:: bash

   attributes:
     checksum:     fa0fc4abf3f6787aeb5c3c5c35de667c
     name:         default.rb
     path:         attributes/default.rb
     specificity:  default
     url:          https://somelongurlhere.com
   chef_type:      cookbook_version
   cookbook_name:  getting-started
   definitions:    []
   files:          []
   frozen?:        false
   json_class:     Chef::CookbookVersion
   libraries:      []

To only view data about "templates", enter:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife cookbook show getting-started 0.3.0 templates

to return something like:

.. code-block:: bash

   checksum:     a29d6f254577b830091f140c3a78b1fe
   name:         chef-getting-started.txt.erb
   path:         templates/default/chef-getting-started.txt.erb
   specificity:  default
   url:          https://someurlhere.com

To see if a cookbook named "redis" with a version number of "0.1.6" is frozen, enter:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife cookbook show redis 0.1.6 | grep frozen

If the cookbook is frozen, something like the following is returned:

.. code-block:: bash

   frozen?:        true
