|knife| comes with a collection of built in subcommands that work together to provide all of the functionality required to take specific actions against any object in a |chef| environment, including cookbooks, nodes, roles, data bags, and environments. A |knife| plugin extends the functionality beyond built-in subcommands.

|knife| has the following subcommands: ``bootstrap``, ``client``, ``configure``, ``cookbook``, ``cookbook site``, ``data bag``, ``environment``, ``exec``, ``index rebuild``, ``node``, ``recipe list``, ``role``, ``search``, ``ssh``, ``status``, and ``tag``.

.. note:: The following subcommand runs only against the open source |chef server|: ``index rebuild``.
