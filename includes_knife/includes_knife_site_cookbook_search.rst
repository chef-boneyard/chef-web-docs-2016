The ``search`` argument is used to search for a cookbook at |url cookbook|. A search query is used to return a list of cookbooks at |url cookbook| and uses the same syntax as the ``search`` sub-command.

This argument has the following syntax::

   knife cookbook site search SEARCH_QUERY (options)

This argument does not have any argument-specific options.

For example, to search for all of the cookbooks that can be used with |apache|, enter:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife cookbook site search apache*

to return something like:

.. code-block:: bash
