The ``create`` argument is used to add a data bag to the |chef server|.

This argument has the following syntax::

   knife data bag create DATA_BAG_NAME [DATA_BAG_ITEM] (options)

This argument has the following options:

``DATA_BAG_ITEM``
   |DATA_BAG_ITEM|

``--secret SECRET``
   |secret|

``--secret-file FILE``
   |secret-file|

.. note:: For encrypted data bag items, use *either* ``--secret`` or ``--secret-file``, not both.

For example, to create a data bag named "admins", enter:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife data bag create admins

to return:

.. code-block:: bash

   Created data_bag[admins]
