The ``server delete`` argument is used to delete one or more instances that are running in the |bluebox| cloud. A block represents the on-demand virtual computing resource; a hostname is specific to a block. To find a specific cloud instance, use the ``knife bluebox server list`` argument. Use the ``knife node delete`` and ``knife client delete`` sub-commands to delete associated node and client objects (if required).

This argument has the following syntax::

   knife bluebox server delete BLOCK_HOSTNAME

``-c CONFIG``, ``--config CONFIG``
