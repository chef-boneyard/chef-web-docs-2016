|opscode| provides the following plugins, which work the same as built-in subcommands (including common options), but must be installed separately (using |rubygems|): ``azure``, ``bluebox``, ``ec2``, ``eucalyptus``, ``google``, ``hp``, ``linode``, ``openstack``, ``rackspace``, ``slicehost``, ``terremark``, and ``windows``.

The |chef| community provides many other plugins for |knife|: http://community.opscode.com/.
