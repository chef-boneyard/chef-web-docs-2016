**All-in-One** configurations are appropriate for small scale environments like proof of concept projects, dedicated fenced development environments, or when the host will be a virtual machine (see the :doc:`Vagrant example </openstack_installation_vagrant>`). This machine need not be large, but sufficient to launch a few virtual instances assuming it is for testing purposes. This is a good way to familiarize yourself with the basics of **Chef for OpenStack**.
