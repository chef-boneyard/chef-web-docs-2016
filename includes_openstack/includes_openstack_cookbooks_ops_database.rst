This cookbook provides a reference implementation for common database installation and configuration across the cookbooks in :doc:`Chef for OpenStack </openstack>`. It is not required by the other cookbooks, they may use alternate implementations of installing their databases and providing the schema. It currently supports MySQL and will soon support PostgreSQL.
