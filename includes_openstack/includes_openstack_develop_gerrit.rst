Gerritt is leveraged to do the code review located https://review.openstack.org/.

* If you would like to pull down all the repositories to start playing around with them, https://gist.github.com/jjasghar/ef5410192f053ebdb6c0O
* You do need to `create an account <https://login.launchpad.net/QSVcvczkg2PH7pM0/+new_account>` here to get gerrit to recognize you
* After you pull down the code, you'll need to follow the steps that Jay Pipes' excellent post `Working with the OpenStack Code Review and CI system – Chef Edition <http://www.joinfu.com/2013/05/working-with-the-openstack-code-review-and-ci-system-chef-edition/>`_
* If you find yourself needing to run the CI again and say Github is having trouble, add a comment "recheck no bug" to re-run the tests.
