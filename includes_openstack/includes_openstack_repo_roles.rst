   * - Role
     - Description
   * - allinone-compute
     - This will deploy all of the services for Openstack Compute to function on a single box. The run list is the ``os-compute-single-controller`` and ``os-compute-worker`` roles.
   * - os-base
     - The OpenStack Base role is included in every other role with a recipe in its run list. The run list is the ``openstack-common::default`` and ``openstack-common::logging`` recipes.
   * - os-block-storage
     - Configures OpenStack block storage, configured by attributes.. The run list is the ``openstack-block-storage::api``, ``openstack-block-storage::scheduler``, ``openstack-block-storage::volume`` and ``openstack-block-storage::identity_registration`` recipes.
   * - os-compute-single-controller
