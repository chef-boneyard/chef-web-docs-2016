If ``http_proxy``, ``https_proxy``, ``ftp_proxy``, or ``no_proxy`` is set in the |client rb| file, the |chef client| will configure the ``ENV`` variable based on these (and related) settings. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   http_proxy 'http://proxy.example.org:8080'
   http_proxy_user 'myself'
   http_proxy_pass 'Password1'

will be set to:

.. code-block:: ruby

   ENV['http_proxy'] = 'http://myself:Password1@proxy.example.org:8080'
