This is the readme for chef-docs.

Notes about this repository:

-- All documents will be in the folders that begin with docs_
-- All documents have dependencies on files that exist in images, includes, swaps, and steps
-- All documents build using Sphinx; build the index file at the root of any docs_ folder
-- Lots of substitutions are present in these files; build the files to see the substitutions

Notes about the swaps folder:

-- swap_descriptions: a list of descriptions that exist across the Chef documents, located here to ensure that the same description exists in the same way across all Chef documents
-- swap_names: a list of proper names (Opscode and 3rd party) to help ensure that these names are used consistently across all documents, and to track names that may require copyright/trademark notation in the future

The following documents are in the repository:

-- Knife Command Line Reference: docs_reference_knife
