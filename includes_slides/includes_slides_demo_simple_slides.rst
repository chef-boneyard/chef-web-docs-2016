.. The contents of this file are included in multiple slide decks.
.. This file should not be changed in a way that hinders its ability to appear in multiple slide decks.


Slides should begin with simple, concise statements followed by a short list. Slides uses a very small subset of the |python sphinx| directive set: 

* Paragraphs, including **bold**, *italics*, and ``code``
* Ordered and unordered lists
* Fully qualified URLs
* Code blocks, both by themselves and within ordered lists
* Images. Used well, images are terrific! Used poorly, well ...
* List-tables, which are tables built using an unordered list and whitespace
* Notes, warnings

Titles are in all-caps and live in the slide map file, separate from the contents of the |rst| file. For more information see http://docs.chef.io/style_guide.html#slide-decks.

.. warning:: Slides do support speaker notes, like this: ``.. rv_note:: This is a speaker note.`` Hit the ``s`` key on the keyboard to view speaker notes.

.. rv_note:: This is a speaker note.
