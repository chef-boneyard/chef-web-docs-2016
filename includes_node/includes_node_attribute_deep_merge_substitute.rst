The following examples show how the logic works for substituting an existing string using a hash::

   role_or_environment 1 { :x => "1", :y => "2" }
   +
   role_or_environment 2 { :y => "3" }
   =
   { :x => "1", :y => "3" }

For substituting an existing boolean using a hash::

   role_or_environment 1 { :x => true, :y => false }
   +
   role_or_environment 2 { :y => true }
   =
   { :x => true, :y => true }

For substituting an array with a hash::

   role_or_environment 1 [ "1", "2", "3" ]
   +
   role_or_environment 2 { :x => "1" , :y => "2" }
   =
   { :x => "1", :y => "2" }

When items cannot be merged through substitution, the original data is overwritten.
