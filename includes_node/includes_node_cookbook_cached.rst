A cookbook is the fundamental unit of distribution across the |chef| organization. All cookbooks are stored as part of the the node object for each node. Each cookbook that is required by a node is then cached on the node, including dependencies such as templates, file distributions, and other cookbooks. Caching cookbooks on the nodes ensures that as much work as possible is done by the |chef client| on the node itself, with minimal interaction between the |chef client| and the |chef server|.
