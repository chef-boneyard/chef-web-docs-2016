   * - Attribute Type
     - Description
   * - ``default``
     - A ``default`` attribute has the lowest attribute precedence and is automatically reset each time |chef| runs. A cookbook should be authored so that it uses ``default`` attributes whenever possible.
   * - ``force_default``
     - A ``force_default`` attribute can be used to ensure that role or environment default attributes do not take precedence over a ``default`` attribute.
   * - ``force_override``
     - A ``force_override`` attribute can be used to ensure that role or environment override attributes do not take precedence over an ``override`` attribute.
   * - ``normal``
     - A ``normal`` attribute is an attribute that persists on the target system and is never reset during a |chef| run. A ``normal`` attribute has a higher attribute precedence than a ``default`` attribute.
   * - ``override``
     - An ``override`` attribute is an attribute that is specified in a recipe (or a run-list) and are often set only for specific roles or nodes. An ``override`` attribute has a higher attribute precedence than ``default`` or ``normal`` attributes. An ``override`` attribute is automatically reset each time |chef| runs. A cookbook should be authored so that it uses ``override`` attributes for role-specific or node-specific values only when required.
   * - ``automatic``
     - An ``automatic`` attribute contains data that is automatically generated by |ohai| during every |chef| run (all previous values are overwritten by the newly generated values). An ``automatic`` attribute cannot be modified and always has the highest attribute precedence.
