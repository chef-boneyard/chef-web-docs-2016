   * - Attribute Type
     - Description
   * - ``default``
     - A default attribute is **jamescott: "A default attribute is what?" (other than the obvious) -- but what's the difference between default an normal and how does an attribute become a "default attribute"?**. A default attribute has the lowest attribute precedence. A default attribute is automatically reset each time |chef| runs. A cookbook should be authored so that it uses default attributes whenever possible.
   * - ``normal``
     - A normal attribute is an attribute that persists on the target system . A normal attribute is never reset during a |chef| run. A normal attribute has a higher attribute precedence than a default attribute.
   * - ``override``
     - An override attribute is an attribute that is specified in a recipe (or a run-list) and are often set only for specific roles or nodes. An override attribute has a higher attribute precedence than default or normal attributes. An override attribute is automatically reset each time |chef| runs. A cookbook should be authored so that it uses override attributes for role-specific or node-specific values when required.
   * - ``automatic``
     - An automatic attribute contains data that is automatically-generated by |ohai| during every |chef| run (all previous values are overwritten by the newly-generated values). An automatic attribute cannot be modified. An automatic attribute has the highest attribute precedence. An automatic attribute is automatically reset each time |chef| runs.
