During a |chef| run, saved attributes are retrieved from the |chef server| and are merged with the attributes on the local system. The attribute type and the source of the attribute determines which attribute values have priority over others. Attribute values are applied in the following order (from low to high priority):

* Default attributes applied in an attributes file
* Default attributes applied in an environment
* Default attributes applied in a role
* Default attributes applied on a node directly in a recipe
* Normal attributes applied in an attributes file
* Normal attributes applied on a node directly in a recipe
* Override attributes applied in an attributes file
* Override attributes applied in a role
* Override attributes applied in an environment
* Override attributes applied on a node directly in a recipe
* Automatic attributes, re-generated by |ohai| during each |chef| run.
