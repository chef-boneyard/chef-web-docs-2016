   Manage a cookbook dependencies, learn more `here <http://berkshelf.com/>`_.

**Chef analytics**
   A feature of |chef| that provides real-time visibility into what is happening on the |chef server|, including what's changing, who made those changes, and when they occurred

**chef-apply**
   A command-line tool that allows a single recipe to be run from the command line.

**chef-client**
   A command-line tool that that runs |chef|. Also, the name of |chef| as it is installed on a node.

**Chef-DK**

**Chef server**
   The |chef server| acts as a hub for configuration data. The |chef server| stores cookbooks, the policies that are applied to nodes, and metadata that describes each registered node that is being managed by the |chef client|. Nodes use the |chef client| to ask the |chef server| for configuration details, such as recipes, templates, and file distributions.

**Chefspec**
   ChefSpec is a unit testing framework for testing Chef cookbooks.

**chef-zero**
   A very lightweight |chef server| that runs in-memory on the local machine during the |chef client| run. Also known as local mode.

**cookbook**
   A cookbook is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution.

**data bag**
   A data_bag is a global variable that is stored as |json| data and is accessible from a |chef server|.

**definition**
   A definition is code that is reused across recipes, similar to a compile-time macro, and is defined in a cookbook.

**Delivery**
   Chef Delivery manages changes to both infrastructure and application code, giving your operations and development teams a common platform for developing, building, testing, and deploying cookbooks, applications, and more. `More information <https://docs.chef.io/release/delivery_1-0/delivery_overview.html/>`_.

**environment**
   An environment is a way to map an organization's real-life workflow to what can be configured and managed when using |chef server|.

**foodcritic**
   A linting tool for doing static code analysis on cookbooks.

**kitchen**
   |kitchen| is an integration framework that is used to automatically test cookbook data across any combination of platforms and test suites. |kitchen| is packaged in the |chef dk|.

**knife**
   A command-line tool that provides an interface between a local |chef repo| and the |chef server|. Use it to manage nodes, cookbooks, recipes, roles, data bags, environments, bootstrapping nodes, searching the |chef server|, and more.

**library**
   A library allows arbitrary |ruby| code to be included in a cookbook, either as a way of extending the classes that are built-in to the |chef client| or by implementing entirely new functionality,

**Management Console**
   The web-based management console to manage Role Based Access Control (RBAC), edit and delete nodes, and reset private keys. Keep up to date with whatâ€™s happening during chef client runs across an entire organization or on specific nodes.

**node**
   A node is any physical, virtual, or cloud machine that is configured to be maintained by a |chef client|.

**node object**
   A history of the attributes, run-lists, and roles that were used to configure a node that is under management by |chef|.

**ohai**
   Ohai is a tool that is used to detect attributes on a node, and then provide these attributes to the |chef client| at the start of every run.

**organization**
   An organization is a single instance of a |chef server|, including all of the nodes that are managed by that |chef server| and each of the workstations that will run |knife| and access the |chef server| using the |api chef server|.

**pipeline**
   A pipeline is series of automated and manual quality gates that take software changes from development to delivery. Pipelines in Chef Delivery have six stages: Verify, Build, Acceptance, Union, Rehearsal, and Delivered.

**policy**
   Policy settings can be used to map business and operational requirements, such as process and workflow, to settings and objects stored on the |chef server|. See roles, environments, and data bags.

**Push Jobs**
   Execute commands across hundreds or even thousands of nodes in your Chef-managed infrastructure.

**recipe**
   A recipe is a collection of resources that tells the |chef client| how to configure a node.

**Rehearsal**
   If all phases of Union succeed, then the Rehearsal stage is triggered. Rehearsal increases confidence in the artifacts and the deployment by repeating the process that occurred in Union in a different environment.

**Reporting**
   Capture and visualize what happens during the execution of chef-client runs across all of your Chef-managed infrastructure.

**resource**
   A resource is a statement of configuration policy that describes the desired state of an piece within your infrastructure, along with the steps needed to bring that item to the desired state.

**role**
   A role is a way to define certain patterns and processes that exist across nodes in an organization as belonging to a single job function.

**run_list**
   A run_list defines all of the configuration settings that are necessary for a node that is under management by |chef| to be put into the desired state and the order in which these configuration settings are applied.

**test-kitchen**
   See kitchen.

**Union**
   Union is the first of the three shared pipeline stages. The purpose of the Union stage is to assess the impact of the change in the context of a complete (or as close as possible) installation of the set of projects that comprise the system as a whole.
