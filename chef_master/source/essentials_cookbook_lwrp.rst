   * - Method
     - Description
   * - :doc:`essentials_cookbook_lwrp_resources_syntax`
     - A lightweight resource is an abstract interface that specifies one (or more) actions that can be taken, one (or more) attributes, and then for each attribute a validation rule that defines how each attribute can be applied.
   * - :doc:`essentials_cookbook_lwrp_resources_common_actions`
     - Use the ``:nothing`` action to do nothing.
   * - :doc:`essentials_cookbook_lwrp_resources_common_attributes`
     - Attributes are available for timeouts, to set the current working directory, specify environment variables, groups, and users.
   * - :doc:`essentials_cookbook_lwrp_resources_common_conditionals`
     - A conditional execution can be used to put additional guards around certain resources so that they are only run when the condition is met.
   * - :doc:`essentials_cookbook_lwrp_resources_common_notifications`
     - Lightweight resources can notify each other to take certain actions.
   * - :doc:`essentials_cookbook_lwrp_resources_common_relative_paths`
