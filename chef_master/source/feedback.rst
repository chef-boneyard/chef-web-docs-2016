Send Feedback
=====================================================
|chef docs| hopes that the documentation is always just what you are looking for, but when that isn't the case |chef docs| does appreciate feedback. There are several ways to get feedback to |chef docs|:

* Email --- Send an email to docs@chef.io for documentation bugs, ideas, thoughts, and suggestions. Typos and little errors and quick fixes will be fixed quickly and without fuss. This email address is not a support email address, however. If you need support for |chef|, contact |company_name| support.
* Github issues --- Use the https://github.com/chef/chef/issues page in the |chef| repo on |github|. Any documentation bug filed here will make its way to |chef docs|. This is a good place for "important" documentation bugs that may need visibility among a larger group within the |chef| community, especially in situations where a doc bug may also surface a product bug.
* Pull request -- The documentation repository is on |github|: https://github.com/chef/chef-docs. A CLA is not required to submit pull requests to this repo. If you are wondering what is going on in that repository, in terms of structure and what-goes-where, send an email to docs@chef.io.
* chef@lists.opscode.com --- |chef docs| follows this mailing list. Improvements to the documentation are made because of conversations that happen on this mailing list. That said, relying solely on the mailing list is the least effective way to get feedback to |chef docs| (because there is no guarantee that |chef docs| will see any particular message).

Thanks in advance for any feedback you choose to send.
