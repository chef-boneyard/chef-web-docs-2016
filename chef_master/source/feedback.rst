Feedback
=====================================================
chef-docs hopes that the documentation is always just what you are looking for, but when that isn't the case chef-docs does appreciate feedback. There are several ways to get feedback to chef-docs:

* Email --- Send an email to docs@opscode.com for documentation bugs, ideas, thoughts, and suggestions. Typos and little errors and quick fixes will be fixed quickly and without fuss. This email address is not a support email address, however. If you need support for |chef|, contact |company_name| support.
* https://tickets.opscode.com --- The official open source ticket tracking system for |chef|. Any documentation bug filed here will eventually make its way to chef-docs. This is a good place for "important" documentation bugs that need visibility among a larger group within the |chef| community.
* Pull request -- The documentation repository is on |github|: https://github.com/opscode/chef-docs. A CLA is not required to submit pull requests to this repo. If you are wondering what is going on in that repository, in terms of structure and what-goes-where, send an email to docs@opscode.com.
* chef@lists.opscode.com --- chef-docs follows this mailing list. Improvements to the documentation are made because of conversations that happen on this mailing list. That said, relying solely on the mailing list is the least effective way to get feedback to chef-docs (because there is no guarantee that chef-docs will see any particular message).

Thanks in advance for any feedback you choose to send.
