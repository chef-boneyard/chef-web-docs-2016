msgid "|chef| is a systems and cloud infrastructure automation framework that makes it easy to deploy servers and applications to any physical, virtual, or cloud location, no matter the size of the infrastructure. |chef| relies on abstract definitions (known as cookbooks and recipes) that are written in |ruby| and are managed like source code. Each definition describes how a specific part of your infrastructure should be built and managed. |chef| then applies those definitions to servers and applications, as specified, resulting in a fully automated infrastructure. When a new server comes online, the only thing that |chef| needs to know is which cookbooks and recipes to apply."
