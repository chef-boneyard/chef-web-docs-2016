msgid "where ``key`` is a field name that is found in the JSON description of an indexable object on the |chef server| (a role, node, client, environment, or data bag) and ``search_pattern`` defines what will be searched for, using one of the following search patterns: exact, wildcard, range, or fuzzy matching. Both ``key`` and ``search_pattern`` are case-sensitive; ``key`` has limited support for multiple character wildcard matching using an asterisk (*) (and as long as it is not the first character)."
