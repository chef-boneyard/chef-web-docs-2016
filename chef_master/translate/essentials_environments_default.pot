msgid "Every |chef| organization must have at least one environment. Every |chef| organization starts out with a single environment that is named ``_default``, which ensures that an environment is always available to the |chef server|. The ``_default`` environment cannot be modified in any way. Nodes, roles, run-lists, cookbooks (and cookbook versions), and attributes specific to an organization can only be associated with a custom environment."
