msgid "The |chef server| acts as a hub for configuration data. The |chef server| stores cookbooks, the policies that are applied to cookbooks, and metadata that describes each registered node in the infrastructure. Nodes use the |chef client| to ask the |chef server| for configuration details, such as recipes, templates, and file distributions. The |chef client| then does as much of the configuration work as possible on the nodes themselves (and not on the |chef server|). This scalable approach distributes the configuration effort throughout the organization."

msgid "|chef hosted| is a version of a |chef server| that is hosted by |opscode|. |chef hosted| is cloud-based, scalable, and available (24x7/365), with resource-based access control. |chef hosted| has all of the automation capabilities of |chef|, but without requiring it to be set up and managed from behind the firewall."

msgid "|chef hosted| evolved out of a need for an infrastructure management tool to be built around the notion of API primitives. By using an API to talk to a cloud provider (such as |amazon vpc|, |windows azure|, or |rackspace|), it allows the freedom to think of those primitives as building blocks. |chef hosted| evolved out of this idea. |chef| only needs to know about the desired state, how it should get there, and what the proper functionality of that desired state should be."

msgid "|chef private| evolved out of a need for customers to have the same functionality provided by |chef hosted|, but located within the organization's firewall. |chef private| is the same as |chef hosted|. |chef hosted| is the largest |chef private| deployment in the world."

msgid "The open source |chef server| is a free version of the |chef server| that contains much of the same functionality as |chef hosted|, but requires that each instance be configured and managed locally, including performing data migrations, applying updates to the open source |chef server|, and ensuring that the open source |chef server| scales as the local infrastructure it is supporting grows. The open source |chef server| includes support from the |chef| community, but does not include support directly from |opscode|."
