Use the ``converge_if_changed`` method inside an ``action`` block in a custom resource to compare the desired property values against the current property values (as loaded by the ``load_current_value`` method). Use the ``converge_if_changed`` method to ensure that updates only occur when property values on the system are not the desired property values and to otherwise prevent a resource from being converged.

To use the ``converge_if_changed`` method, wrap it around the part of a recipe or custom resource that should only be converged when the current state is not the desired state:

.. code-block:: ruby

   action :some_action do
   
     converge_if_changed
       # some property
     end
   
   end

For example, a custom resource defines two properties (``content`` and ``path``) and a single action (``:create``). Use the ``load_current_value`` method to load the property value to be compared, and then use the ``converge_if_changed`` method to tell the |chef client| what to do if that value is not the desired value:

.. code-block:: ruby

   property :content, String
   property :path, String, name_property: true
   
   load_current_value do
     if File.exist?(path)
       content IO.read(path)
     end
   end
   
   action :create do
     converge_if_changed do
       IO.write(path, content)
     end
   end

When the file does not exist, the ``IO.write(path, content)`` code is executed and the |chef client| output will print something similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   Recipe: recipe_name::block
     * resource_name[blah] action create
       - update my_file[blah]
       -   set content to "hola mundo" (was "hello world")
