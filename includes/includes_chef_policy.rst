Policy settings can be used to map the capabilities of |chef| to organizational requirements. For example, custom environments can be mapped to an organization's actual processes and workflow. Roles define server types, such as "web server" or "database server". Certain types of data, such as passwords, user account data, and other sensitive items can be placed in data bags, which are located in a secure sub-area of |chef| that can only be accessed by nodes that have the correct |ssl| certificates.
