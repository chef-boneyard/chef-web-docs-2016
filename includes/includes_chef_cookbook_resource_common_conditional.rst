A conditional execution can be used to put additional guards around certain resources so that they are only run when the condition is met. The most common reason for using a conditional execution is to ensure that the ``execute`` resource is idempotent, but conditional executions can be used with any resource.

In both cases, the attribute is ``true`` when the command returns ``0``).
