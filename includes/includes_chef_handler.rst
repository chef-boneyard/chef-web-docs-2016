A handler is a feature of |chef| that is used to trigger certain behaviors in response to certain situations, typically identified during a |chef run|.

* An exception handler is used to trigger behaviors when a defined aspect of a |chef| run fails.
* A report handler is used to trigger behaviors when a defined aspect of a |chef| run is successful. 

Both types of handlers can be used to gather data about a |chef| run, and when used across the entire |chef| organization, can provide rich levels of data about all types of |chef| usage that can be used later for trending and analysis.
