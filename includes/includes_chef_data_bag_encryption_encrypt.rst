An encrypted data bag item can be created with a |knife| command similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   knife data bag create passwords mysql --secret-file /tmp/my_data_bag_key

where "passwords" is the name of the data bag, "mysql" is the name of the data bag item, and "/tmp/my_data_bag_key" is the path to the location in which the file that contains the secret-key is located. |knife| will ask for user credentials before the encrypted data bag item is saved.
