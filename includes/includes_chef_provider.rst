A provider moves resources from current to desired states by taking a default or user-selected action. There are many providers in |chef| and they all work on behalf of resources that are defined in recipes. A resource defines a package or a service or a template and then specifies an action. A provider then does the work that is required to implement that action. The provider needs to know the current state, and then takes the action(s) that are required to move to the desired state. For example, on a |redhat| or |centos| machine a package will use the |redhat yum| package provider to get the package installed, but on a |debian| or an |ubuntu| machine the |apt| package installer is used instead. All the provider needs to know is that a resource specified an action that requires installation of a package. The provider will make sure that installation happens in the right ways on the right platforms and will only take the steps that are required to complete that action.
