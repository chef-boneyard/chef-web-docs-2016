The |resource remote directory| resource is used to recursively transfer a directory from a cookbook's files or default directory. A remote directory will obey file specificity; the directory that will be copied should be located under COOKBOOK_NAME/files/default/REMOTE_DIRECTORY. A host-or distribution-specific path can also be used.
