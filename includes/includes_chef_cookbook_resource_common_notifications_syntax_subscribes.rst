A resource must be defined before another resource may subscribe to it. The basic syntax of a ``subscribes`` notification is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   resource "name" do
     subscribes :action, resources(:resource_type => "resource_name"), :notification_timing
   end

or:

.. code-block:: ruby

   resource "name" do
     subscribes :action, resources("resource[resource_name]"), :notification_timing
   end
