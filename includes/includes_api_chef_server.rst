The |api chef server| is used to provide access to objects on the |chef server|, including nodes, environments, roles, cookbooks (and cookbook versions), and to manage an |chef api client| list and the associated RSA public key-pairs. (The |chef api client| list should be managed using |knife| or the |chef server| management console, as opposed to the |api chef server|.)
