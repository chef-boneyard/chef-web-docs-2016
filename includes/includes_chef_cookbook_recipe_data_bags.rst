The contents of a data bag can be loaded into a recipe. For example, a data bag named "apps" and a data bag item named "my_app"::

   {
     "id": "my_app",
     "repository": "git://github.com/company/my_app.git"
   }

can be accessed in a recipe, like this::

   my_bag = data_bag_item("apps", "my_app")

The data bag item's keys and values can be accessed with a |ruby| hash::

   my_bag["repository"] #=> "git://github.com/company/my_app.git"
