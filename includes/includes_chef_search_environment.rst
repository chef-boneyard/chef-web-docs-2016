When searching, a |chef| environment (``chef_environment``) is treated much like an attribute. This allows search results to be limited to a specified environment by using Boolean operators and extra search terms. For example, to use |knife| to search for all of the servers running |centos| in an environment named "QA", enter the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   knife search node "chef_environment:QA AND platform:centos"

Or, to include the same search in a recipe, use a code block similar to::

   qa_nodes = search(:node,"chef_environment:QA")      
   qa_nodes.each do |qa_node|                          
       # Do useful specific to qa nodes only
   end
