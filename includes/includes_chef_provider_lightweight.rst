A lightweight provider is a custom provider that is designed to work with a resource that does not already exist in the |chef| provider platform.

.. note:: Typically, using a lightweight provider is the best (and recommended) way of handling a resource that does not already exist. If using a lightweight provider is not an option, then creating a custom provider might be the best approach. Please use the |chef| IRC channel to contact us and we will help you get started.
