|chef| is comprised of three main elements: a server, one (or more) nodes, and at least one workstation. The |chef server| acts as a hub, ensuring that the right cookbooks are used, that the right policies are being applied, that all of the node objects are up-to-date, and that all of the nodes that will be maintained are registered and known to the |chef server|. The workstation is the location from which most of the work happens, including authoring cookbooks, synchronizing with the repository, and uploading certain information to the server. The nodes host the various servers and applications in the cloud or on physical devices; each node contains a |chef client| that performs the various infrastructure automation tasks that each node requires.
