A |knife rb| file is used to store repository-specific configuration details for |knife|. If a |knife rb| file is present in the |path chef knife rb secondary| directory in the |chef| repository, the settings contained within that file will override the |knife| configuration settings contained within the |knife rb| file found at |path chef knife rb|. A |knife rb| file does not need to be in the |chef| repository if the primary |knife rb| file contains the correct settings.
