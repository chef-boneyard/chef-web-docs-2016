Attribute accessor methods are automatically created and the method invocation can be used interchangeably with the keys. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   default.apache.dir          = "/etc/apache2"
   default.apache.listen_ports = [ "80","443" ]

This is a matter of style and preference for how attributes are reloaded from recipes **jamescott: check the wiki page here**, and may be seen when "retrieving" the value of an attribute.
