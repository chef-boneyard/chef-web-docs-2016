.. This is an included how-to. 

The following example shows how start a service named "example_service" and immediately notify the |nginx| service to restart.

.. code-block:: ruby

   service "example_service" do
     action :start
     provider Chef::Provider::Service::Init
     notifies :restart, "service[nginx]", :immediately
   end

where by using the default ``provider`` for the |resource service|, the recipe is telling |chef| to determine the specific provider to be used during the |chef| run based on the platform of the node on which the recipe will run.
