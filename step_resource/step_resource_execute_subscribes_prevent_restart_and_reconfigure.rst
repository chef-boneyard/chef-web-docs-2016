.. This is an included how-to. 


Use the ``:nothing`` common action to prevent an application from restarting, and then use the ``subscribes`` notification to ask the broken configuration to be reconfigured immediately:

.. code-block:: ruby

   execute "test-nagios-config" do
     command "nagios3 --verify-config"
     action :nothing
     subscribes :run, "template[/etc/nagios3/configures-nagios.conf]", :immediately
   end
