.. This is an included how-to. 

To reload a service based on a template, use the |resource template| and |resource service| resources together in the same recipe, similar to the following:

.. code-block:: ruby

   template "/tmp/somefile" do
     mode "0644"
     source "somefile.erb"
   end

   service "apache" do
     supports :restart => true, :reload => true
     action :enable
     subscribes :reload, "template[/tmp/somefile]", :immediately
   end

where the ``subscribes`` notification is used to reload the service using the template specified by the |resource template| resource.
