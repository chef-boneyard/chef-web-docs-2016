The PUT method is used to update a specific user. If values are not specified for the PUT method, the |chef server| will use the existing values rather than assign default values.

PUT accepts a boolean ``{ "private_key": "true" }``. If this is specified, a new private key is generated.

If values are missing, they will not be overwritten. If ``public_key`` is null, the public key will not be overwritten.

.. note:: PUT supports renames. If ``PUT /user/foo`` is requested with { "name: "bar""}, then it will rename ``foo`` to ``bar`` and all of the content previously associated with ``foo`` will be associated with ``bar``.

This method has no parameters.

**Request**

.. code-block:: xml

   PUT /user/NAME

with a request body that looks something like:

.. code-block:: javascript

   POST /users { "name": "Grant McLennan" }

**Response**

The response will return something like the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "name": "Grant McLennan",
     "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n
                   MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCyVPW9YXa5PR0rgEW1updSxygB\n
                   wmVpDnHurgQ7/gbh+PmY49EZsfrZSbKgSKy+rxdsVoSoU+krYtHvYIwVfr2tk0FP\n
                   nhAWJaFH654KpuCNG6x6iMLtzGO1Ma/VzHnFqoOeSCKHXDhmHwJAjGDTPAgCJQiI\n
                   eau6cDNJRiJ7j0/xBwIDAQAB\n
                   -----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
     "admin": false
   }

If a new private key was generated, both the private and public keys are returned.
