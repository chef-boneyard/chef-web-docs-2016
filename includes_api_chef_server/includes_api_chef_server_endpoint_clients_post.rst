The POST method is used to create a new |chef api client|.

This method has no parameters.

**Request**

.. code-block:: xml

   POST /clients

with a request body that looks something like:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "name": "name_of_API_client",
     "admin": false
   }

where ``name_of_API_client`` is the name of the |chef api client| to be created and ``admin`` indicates whether the |chef api client| will be run as an admin |chef api client|.

**Response**

The response will return something like the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "uri": "http://localhost:4000/clients/monkeypants",
     "private_key": "RSA PRIVATE KEY"
   }

Store the private key in a safe place. It will be required later (along with the client name) to access the |chef server| when using the |api chef server|.
