The ``POST`` method is used to create a new |chef api client|.

This method has no parameters.

**Request**

.. code-block:: xml

   POST /organizations/NAME/clients

with a request body similar to:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "name": "name_of_API_client",
     "admin": false,
     "create_key" : true
   }

where ``name_of_API_client`` is the name of the |chef api client| to be created and ``admin`` indicates whether the |chef api client| will be run as an admin |chef api client|.

**Response**

The response is similar to:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "uri"=>"https://chef.example/orgaizations/org1/clients/client1",
     "chef_key" : {
       "name" : "default",
       "public_key" : "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----",
       "private_key" : "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
   }

Store the private key in a safe place. It will be required later (along with the client name) to access the |chef server| when using the |api chef server|.
