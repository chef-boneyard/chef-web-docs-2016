The GET method is used to return a data structure that contains links to each available search index. By default, the ``role``, ``node``, ``client``, and ``data bag`` indexes will always be available (where the ``data bag`` index is the name of the data bag on the |chef server|). Search indexes may lag behind the most current data at any given time. If a situation occurs where data needs to be written and then immediately searched, an artificial delay (of at least 10 seconds) is recommended.

This method has no parameters.
