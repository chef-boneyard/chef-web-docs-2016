Authentication to the |chef server| occurs when a specific set of HTTP headers are signed using a private key that is associated with the machine from which the request is made. The request is authorized if the |chef server| can verify the signature using the public key. Only authorized actions are allowed.

.. note:: Most authentication requests made to the |chef server| are abstracted from the user. Such as when using the |chef server| user interface or when using |knife|. In some cases, such as when using the ``knife exec`` subcommand, the authentication requests need to be made more explicitly, but in a way that does not require authentication headers. In a few cases, such as when using arbitrary |ruby| code or |curl|, it may be necessary to include the full authentication header as part of the request to the |chef server|.
