private-chef-ctl

Private Chef has a command line utility, private-chef-ctl, which is used to perform the majority of the administrative activities associated with Private Chef, such as managing services, configuring the servers, and watching logs.

private-chef-ctl takes commands as arguments, and each command is documented below. To execute a command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ private-chef-ctl COMMAND

Where COMMAND is replaced with any of the commands below.


General Commands

help

Print a list of all the available private-chef-ctl commands.

reconfigure

When changes are made to /etc/opscode/private-chef.rb, the private-chef-ctl reconfigure command is used to dynamically reconfigure the server. Until this command is run, no changes have been made to the configuration of any of the private chef services

show-config

View the configuration that will be generated by private-chef-ctl reconfigure. This is useful in the early stages of a deployment, to ensure that everything will be built properly prior to installation.

cleanse

The cleanse command re-sets a server to the state it was in before the first run of private-chef-ctl reconfigure. It will destroy all the data, configuration files, and logs.

uninstall

The uninstall command is intended to be run before removing Private Chef from a system when you wish to uninstall the Private Chef software but do not want to delete its data.

The uninstall command will completely shut down all services, including the runit process supervisor. To revert an uninstall command, a user would need to run private-chef-ctl reconfigure, since private-chef-ctl start will have its functionality disabled by the pre-uninstall.



High Availability Commands

master-recover

When running in a High Availability cluster, this command will force the server to attempt to become the HA Master. Should usually be run in tandem with private-chef-ctl backup-recover on the back-end peer, unless it is no longer available.

backup-recover

The opposite of private-chef-ctl master-recover - forces the server to attempt to become the HA Backup. If run on both back-end servers, will put the cluster in a state where no server holds the DRBD resource.




Services Commands

service-list

Displays a list of all the private chef services. Those enabled on the machine are labeled with an *.

status

Shows the status of the private chef services. The output will vary based on the configuration of a given server.

This command can also be run for an individual service, rather than every service:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ private-chef-ctl opscode-solr status

Any service listed in private-chef-ctl service-list can replace opscode-solr in the above.


How to read a status line

Private Chef has a built in process supervisor, which makes sure all the required services are in the appropriate state at any given time. The supervisor starts two processes per service:

The service itself
A process to capture the services logs
A typical status line for a running service on a non-high availability private chef server:

run: opscode-solr: (pid 1486) 7819s; run: log: (pid 1485) 7819s
The first segment, run, describes the state the supervisor is attempting to keep the process in. Most commonly, this is either run (when the service should be up and running) or down, meaning the service should be stopped.

The second segment is the service name itself - in this case, opscode-solr.

The third segment is the process ID of the running service process (pid 14866), followed by how long the process as been running in seconds (7819s).

The fourth segment begins after the semicolon - the pattern then repeats for the log process. Note that it is typical that the log process may have a longer run time than the service it is managing: this is a side-effect of the fact that the supervisor does not need to restart the log process to connect supervised processes to the logger.

The status line for the same service, only stopped:

down: opscode-solr: 3s, normally up; run: log: (pid 1485) 8526s
Note that the first segment has changed to down, and the third segment is now the time the service has been down, followed by the fact that the service is normally up. This means the supervisor would attempt to start this service on reboot - given no other input, the service would “normally be up”.

Reading status on High Availability Servers

On high availability back-ends, whether a service should be running or not is controlled by our clustering service, keepalived. When running private-chef-ctl status on these nodes, a few things change:

On the back-end node that is currently the “backup” server, it would be normal to see only the keepalived and nrpe processes as running.
On the back-end node that is currently the “master” server, it would be normal to see all the services running, but to have normally down appear in the third segment. This reflects the fact that, on reboot, this server would not attempt to start these services: instead, it would allow keepalived to decide whether they should be running based on the cluster state.
A sample status line for a service on a High Availability “master”:

run: opscode-solr: (pid 25341) 239s, normally down; run: log: (pid 5700) 145308s
ha-status
Check the status of the H/A configuration of private chef services. This command will check that:

The keepalived daemon is enabled in the config.
The DRBD process is enabled in the config.
The underlying block device or logical volume for drbd has been created and configured.
The DRBD device exists.
The current state of the server is ‘master’ or ‘backup’ and that any migration has completed.
The failover VIP is correctly attached to only the ‘master’ node.
The DRBD state is correct based on the state of the server being ‘master’ or ‘backup’.
The DRBD mount point is correctly mounted to only the ‘master’ node.
The DRBD replication IPs (typically connected via crossover cable) are both pingable.
The runit status of the services are correct (up or down) based on the ‘master’ or ‘backup’ state.
If this command succeeds, it will print that everything is okay on the last line:

[OK] all checks passed.
Otherwise it will print out that errors were detected on the last line; the precise error will be listed in the output above:

...
[OK] nginx is running correctly, and I am master.
[ERROR] nrpe is not running.
[OK] opscode-account is running correctly, and I am master.
...

[ERROR] ERRORS WERE DETECTED.



start
Start all the enabled private chef services.

You can also start only a single service, rather than all services:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ private-chef-ctl opscode-solr start


Note
The private chef supervisor is configured to wait seven seconds for a service to respond to a command from the supervisor. If you see output that references a “timeout”, it means that the signal has been sent to the process, but that it has yet to actually comply. In general, you can not worry about timed out processes, unless they are failing to respond to the signals at all - in which case you may need to escalate to using a command such as private-chef-ctl kill.

stop
Stop all the enabled private chef services.

You can also stop only a single service:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ private-chef-ctl opscode-solr stop

restart
Restart all the enabled private chef services.

You can also restart only a single service:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ private-chef-ctl opscode-solr restart


once

The supervisor is configured to restart any services that fail, unless we have specifically asked them to change their state. This command changes this behavior - it tells the supervisor that, should any service fail, do not attempt to restart it (“Run it once”). This command is usually used when troubleshooting configuration errors that cause a service to fail to start: running private-chef-ctl once followed by private-chef-ctl status, and looking for services in the down state will tell you what services are having trouble.

You can also tell only a specific service to run once:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ private-chef-ctl opscode-solr once


hup

Send a SIGHUP to all the services.

You can also hup only a specific service:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ private-chef-ctl opscode-solr hup


term

Send a SIGTERM to all the services.

You can also send term to only a specific service:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ private-chef-ctl opscode-solr term

int

Send a SIGINT to all the services.

You can also send int to only a specific service:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ private-chef-ctl opscode-solr int


kill

Send a SIGKILL to all the services.

You can also send a kill to only a specific service:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ private-chef-ctl opscode-solr kill


tail

Follow the Private Chef logs for all services.

You can also watch the logs of a specific service:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ private-chef-ctl opscode-solr tail


User Administration Commands

password

Lets you change a user’s password.

When LDAP/AD is enabled, this command enables (or disables) an account’s System Recovery Password.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ private-chef-ctl password adamjacobs
   Enter the new password:  ******
   Enter the new password again:  ******
   Password for adamjacobs successfully set.

To disable the user’s System Recovery Password, pass –disable on the command line:

$ private-chef-ctl password adamjacobs --disable

Password for adamjacobs successfully disabled for System Recovery.
