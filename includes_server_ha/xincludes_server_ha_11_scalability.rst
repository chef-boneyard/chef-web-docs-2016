Scalability for front-end servers is achieved by horizontally scaling the number of servers.

Scalability for back-end servers is achieved by vertically scaling the servers. For example, adding memory, CPU, and faster disks will all increase throughput from the back-end servers. Faster disks, and dedicated network interface cards will all increase the reliability of |drbd| and the responsiveness of |chef server oec|.
