The ``cookbook_name`` method can be used in a recipe to return the name of a cookbook. The syntax for the ``cookbook_name`` method is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

This method is often used as part of a log entry. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Chef::Log.info("I am a message from the #{recipe_name} recipe in the #{cookbook_name} cookbook.")
