The ``platform?`` method can be used in a recipe to ensure that certain actions are run for specific platform. The ``platform?`` method will return true if one of the listed parameters matches the ``node['platform']`` attribute that is detected by |ohai| during every |chef| run. The syntax for the ``platform?`` method is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   platform?("parameter", "parameter")

where ``parameter`` is a comma-separated list, each specifying a platform, such as |redhat|, |centos|, or |fedora|. The ``platform?`` method is typically used with an ``if``, ``elseif``, or ``case`` statement that contains |ruby| code that is specific for the platform, if detected. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   if platform?("redhat", "centos", "fedora")
     # code for only redhat family systems.
   end

or:

.. code-block:: ruby

   if platform?("ubuntu")
     # code for only ubuntu systems
   end

or:

.. code-block:: ruby

   if platform?("ubuntu")
     # do ubuntu things
   end

or:

.. code-block:: ruby

   if platform?("freebsd", "openbsd")
     # do bsd things
   end
