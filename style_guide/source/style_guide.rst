The |opscode| style guide is just a limited subset of the full capabilities of Sphinx, with regard to formatting and authoring options. Generally, if it's not listed here, we're not using it.

All of the documents built by Sphinx for Chef can be found at docs.opscode.com.

Basic Documentation Template
=====================================================
All documents must have a title, must refer to any files that provide inline text replacement (swaps files), and a body.

Topic Titles
-----------------------------------------------------
Each topic can have a single topic title. What it looks like as reST:: 

   =====================================================
   header name goes here
   =====================================================

This is the only section header that requires the structure above and below the header.

Body
-----------------------------------------------------
The body of the topic contains anything else needed for the topic. Often, a topic contains an include file (or three), and then some topics contain sub-headers. Most of the topics that are published to docs.opscode.com contain a series of includes files. But some topics, like An Overview of Chef, include original content alongside the includes files. It just depends on what the topic requires.

Example
-----------------------------------------------------
The following example is the first two sections from "An Overview of Chef"::

      =====================================================
      An Overview of |chef|
      =====================================================
      
      .. include:: ../../includes_chef/includes_chef.rst
      
      The following diagram shows the relationships between the various elements of a |chef| organization, 
      including the nodes, the server, and the workstations. These elements work together to provide |chef| 
      the information and instruction that it needs so that it can do its job. As you are reviewing the rest 
      of this doc, use the icons in the tables to refer back to this image.
      
      .. image:: ../../images/overview_chef_draft.png
      
      .. include:: ../../includes_chef/includes_chef_key_elements.rst
      
      The following sections discuss these elements (and their various components) in more detail.
      
      Nodes
      =====================================================
      .. include:: ../../includes_node/includes_node.rst

      There are two types of nodes that |chef| can manage:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 60 420
      :header-rows: 1
      
      * - Feature
        - Description
      * - .. image:: ../../images/icon_node_cloud.png
        - .. include:: ../../includes_node/includes_node_cloud.rst
      * - .. image:: ../../images/icon_node_physical.png
        - .. include:: ../../includes_node/includes_node_physical.rst
      
   Some important components on nodes include:
      
   .. list-table::
      :widths: 60 420
      :header-rows: 1
      
      * - Feature
        - Description
      * - .. image:: ../../images/icon_chef_client.png
        - .. include:: ../../includes_chef/includes_chef_client.rst
      * - .. image:: ../../images/icon_ohai.png
        - .. include:: ../../includes_ohai/includes_ohai.rst
      
   |chef| uses RSA public key-pairs to authenticate a |chef client| with the |chef server| every time a 
   |chef client| needs access to data that is stored on the |chef server|. This prevents any node from 
   accessing data that it shouldn't and ensures that only nodes that are properly registered with the 
   |chef| server can be managed by |chef|.

Section Headers
=====================================================
Section headers create structure in a document. When section headers are part of a topic that is included in other topics, those headers are treated as if they first appeared at that location (and are bumped down appropriately). For this, and for other cosmetic reasons, the headers in Opscode documents are limited to 4 levels beyond the topic title. If headers are required beyond that, they should only be done using standard emphasis and white space or through some other creative method (such as creating more topics with less TOC depth).

Sphinx allows many different conventions for how headers can exist in documents and looks for consistency to determine which ones go where. The width of the header must be equal to (or longer) than the length of the text in the header and (ideally) the same width for headers are used everywhere. (Having everything the same width can help spot the headers during reviews or when trying to find bugs in topics. The following sections describe the section header pattern that Opscode is using for topic titles, H1s, H2s, H3s, H4s, and the occasional H5.

.. note:: As a general rule, try to limit the number of header levels to no more than 2 within a topic. There can be exceptions, of course, and especially if the document is very large, but remember that HTML TOC structures usually have width limitations (on the display side) and the more structure within a TOC, the harder it can be for users to figure out what's in it.

H1
-----------------------------------------------------
If a topic requires a sub-header, this is the first one to use. What it looks like as reST:: 

   header name goes here
   =====================================================
   This is the paragraph.

H2
-----------------------------------------------------
If an H1 requires a sub-header, this is one to use. Sphinx will generate errors if this header is not a child of an H1. What it looks like as reST:: 

   header name goes here
   -----------------------------------------------------
   This is the paragraph.

H3
-----------------------------------------------------
If an H2 requires a sub-header, this is one to use. Sphinx will generate errors if this header is not a child of an H2. What it looks like as reST:: 

   header name goes here
   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
   This is the paragraph.

H4
-----------------------------------------------------
If a . What it looks like as reST:: 

   header name goes here
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   This is the paragraph.

H5
-----------------------------------------------------
Only 4 levels of headers are supported (title, H2, H3, and H4). If, in the rare instance a lower-level header is needed, use a bold emphasis and then white space to provide the visual treatment and content separation. What it looks like as reST:: 

   **header name goes here**  << in regular bold emphasis
     << this is a hard return
   content, as normally authored.

What an "H5 header" link looks like after it's built:

**Header**

content, as normally authored.


Lists and Tables
=====================================================
Lists and tables can be useful. The following sections describe the various lists and tables that Opscode is using for its documentation.

Bullet Lists
-----------------------------------------------------
Bulleted lists are useful for breaking up text blocks and for drawing attention to a group of items. What it looks like as reST:: 

   * text goes here
   * text goes here
   * text goes here
   * text goes here

Use the asterisk symbol (*) only for bulleted lists, even though Sphinx supports using other symbols. For example:

* text goes here
* text goes here
* text goes here
* text goes here

Numbered Lists
-----------------------------------------------------
Numbered lists are good for when people need to understand a list of information in a specific order, such as for how-tos or for process details. What it looks like as reST:: 

   #. text goes here
   #. text goes here
   #. text goes here
   #. text goes here

Use the number symbol (#) to let Sphinx handle the actual ordering. If the number list needs to change later, you don't have to worry about making sure the numbers are in the correct order. For example:

#. text goes here
#. text goes here
#. text goes here
#. text goes here

Definition Lists
-----------------------------------------------------
These are used primarily to show the options available to a command line tool. These appear the same way in the HTML and print documentation as they appear in the man page output. What it looks like as reST:: 
   
   ``--name-only``
      |name only|
   
   ``--name-status``
      |name status|
   
   ``--no-recurse``
      |no recurse diff|

What it looks like after it's built:

``--name-only``
   |name only|

``--name-status``
   |name status|

``--no-recurse``
   |no recurse diff|

List Tables
-----------------------------------------------------
The list table is the only table style that Opscode is using in the docs. Sphinx supports other approaches to tables, but they are crude and inelegant and are a pain so why bother with them. What the list table looks like as reST:: 

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 250 250
      :header-rows: 1
      
      * - Header
        - Description
      * - text, image, swap, or include
        - text, image, swap, or include
      * - text, image, swap, or include
        - text, image, swap, or include

The table cells support images and includes, along with all of the other standard Sphinx that is being used here. The widths can be changed and the number of columns can be changed too. In general, Opscode is trying to keep the number of columns below 4. When creating a list table, think about what it will look like in HTML and in print formats, with regard to the table's width. If your document is going into a man page, list tables are not recommended.

What the list table looks like after it's built::

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 60 420
      :header-rows: 1
      
      * - Header
        - Description
      * - .. image:: ../../images/icon_node_cloud.png
        - .. include:: ../../includes_node/includes_node_cloud.rst
      * - .. image:: ../../images/icon_node_physical.png
        - .. include:: ../../includes_node/includes_node_physical.rst

Inline Markup
=====================================================
Adding emphasis within text strings can be done using **bold**, *italics*, and ``code strings``.

Bold
-----------------------------------------------------
Use two asterisks (*) to mark a text string as **bold**. What it looks like as reST:: 

   **text goes here**

Italics
-----------------------------------------------------
Use a single asterisk (*) to mark a text string as *italics*. What it looks like as reST:: 

   *text goes here*

Code Strings
-----------------------------------------------------
Sometimes the name of a method or database field needs to be used inline in a paragraph. Use two backquotes (`) to mark certain strings as code within a regular string of text. What it looks like as reST:: 

   ``code goes here``

What it looks like in a paragraph:

Sometimes if an API ``method`` or database ``table`` needs to be referred to in a paragraph, it's useful to apply a style to that ``item`` so that readers can tell that it's special.

Links
=====================================================
Links are ways to get users to other useful topics.

Internal
-----------------------------------------------------
An internal link is one that resolves to another topic that is built by Sphinx. What it looks like as reST:: 

   :doc:`essentials_nodes`

where ``:doc:`` tells Sphinx that what follows is a file name that Sphinx will encounter during the build process. If this isn't formatted correctly, Sphinx will let you know.

Internal, with short link names
-----------------------------------------------------
An internal link is one that resolves to another topic that is built by Sphinx. Sometimes it's better to have the name of the link that displays be as short as possible (and different from the actual title of the topic). What it looks like as reST:: 

   :doc:`Actions </resource_common_actions>`

where ``:doc:`` tells Sphinx that what follows is a file name that Sphinx will encounter during the build process. ``Actions`` represents the short name that will display on the page in which this internal link is located, and then ``resource_common_actions`` is the filename and is contained within brackets (< >). If this isn't formatted correctly, Sphinx will let you know.

External
-----------------------------------------------------
An external link points to something that does not live on docs.opscode.com. An external link requires an HTTP address. In general, it's better to spell out the HTTP address fully, in case the topic is printed out. What an external link looks like as reST:: 

   http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby

What an external link looks like after it's built:

"A great tool for learning Ruby is http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby."


TOC Trees
=====================================================
A TOC tree defines all of the topics that are children of this topic. In Sphinx outputs, the Previous and Next patterns use this topic structure to determine these links. In addition, a visible TOC will use the structure defined by the ``toctree`` directive. In general, Opscode is not using the visible TOC tree, but they still need to be present in the topics to keep Sphinx happy. What the hidden ``toctree`` looks like as reST:: 

   .. toctree::
      :hidden:
   
      chef_overview
      just_enough_ruby_for_chef
      ...

Code Blocks
=====================================================
Code blocks are used to show code samples, such as those for Ruby, JSON, and command-line strings. There are many options here, especially if Pygments is part of your Sphinx environment. The most common code block styles are shown below, but there are many lexers available.

.. note:: For more information about all of the code styles that Pygments supports, see: http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/#lexers-for-other-languages.

Ruby
-----------------------------------------------------
Use this approach to show code blocks that use Ruby. What it looks like as reST:: 

   .. code-block:: ruby

      default["apache"]["dir"]          = "/etc/apache2"
      default["apache"]["listen_ports"] = [ "80","443" ]

and what it looks like after it's built:

.. code-block:: ruby

   default["apache"]["dir"]          = "/etc/apache2"
   default["apache"]["listen_ports"] = [ "80","443" ]

Bash
-----------------------------------------------------
Use this approach to show code blocks that use any type of shell command, such as for Knife or the chef-client or for any other command-line example that may be required. What it looks like as reST:: 

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ knife data bag create admins

and what it looks like after it's built:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife data bag create admins

Javascript (and JSON)
-----------------------------------------------------
Use this approach to show code blocks that use any type of JavaScript, including any JSON code sample. What it looks like as reST:: 

   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      {
         "id": "charlie",
         "uid": 1005,
         "gid":"ops",
         "shell":"/bin/zsh",
         "comment":"Crazy Charlie"
      }

and what it looks like after it's built:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "id": "charlie",
      "uid": 1005,
      "gid":"ops",
      "shell":"/bin/zsh",
      "comment":"Crazy Charlie"
   }

Literal
-----------------------------------------------------
These should be used sparingly, but sometimes there is a need for a block of text that doesn't fit neatly into one of the options available for ``code-block``, such as showing a directory structure, basic syntax, or pseudocode. What it looks like as reST:: 

   a preceding paragraph that ends with a double colon::

      a block of literal text indented three spaces
        with more
        text as required to
        complete the block of text.
      end.

and what it looks like after it's built:

.. code-block:: javascript

   a block of literal text indented three spaces
     with more
     text as required to
     complete the block of text.
   end.

Includes
-----------------------------------------------------
An includes file is a way to use a path to pull content into a topic at build time. This allows the contents of a topic to be sourced in one location, yet used within any deliverable that requires it. What it looks like as reST:: 

   .. include:: ../../includes_chef/includes_chef.rst

What it looks like after it's built:

.. include:: ../../includes_chef/includes_chef.rst

Inline Replacements
=====================================================
A swap file is a file that contains short strings of information that are replaced at build time. Mostly, these are definitions of command-line options, descriptions of settings in |ruby| files, and other short descriptions that may live in more than one place across the doc set.

They are grouped by letter (for definition strings, a-z), grouped by names (for product name and other formal names), for notes, and for HTTP links. These should only be included when it's certain that, should the swap replacement need to change later, that that change is exactly what is wanted in that location later.

What it looks like as reST:: 

   |mac os x|

or::

   |homebrew|

or::

   |knife rb|

or::

   |resource deploy|

or::

   |chef client|

and what it looks like in the document::

   I like to use |homebrew| on my |mac os x| machine when managing my |knife rb| file that I 
   use with my |chef client| every time the |resource deploy| resource is run.

and what that would look like after it's built: "I like to use Homebrew on my Mac OS X machine when managing my knife.rb file that I use with my chef-client every time the **deploy** resource is run."

Notes and Warnings
=====================================================
In general, notes and warnings are not the ideal way to present information. Before using them ask yourself if this wouldn't be better represented as an actual section header. If it's truly important, then it is information you want the reader to find, and the best way to ensure that is to write the topics so that important information has its own section header. This helps the search engines pick up the information and provide better search results. If notes and warnings must be used, the approach for using them is as follows.

Notes
-----------------------------------------------------
Use sparingly, but much more often than a warning. A note sometimes works best when they are consistently used across a wide set of topics. Some people just read docs looking for notes and images and steps. Notes shouldn't be used in a way that discourages people from reading the docs. If something is really important, the best place for it is a location that gives it a spot in the TOC, with its own topic title, and so on.

See the What it looks like as reST:: 

   .. note:: this is a note.

What a note looks like after it's built:

.. note:: this is a note.

Warnings
-----------------------------------------------------
Use sparingly, so that when the user sees a warning it registers appropriately. A warning really should be a "Hey, if you do this, you might break your environment." type of situation. What it looks like as reST:: 

   .. warning:: this is a warning.

What a warning looks like after it's built:

.. warning:: this is a warning. if you do this, your hard drive will be deleted.

Images
=====================================================
Images are useful and can be better at telling readers what is going on than actual text. What it looks like as reST::

   .. image:: ../../images/icon_chef_client.png

What an image looks like after it's built:

.. image:: ../../images/icon_chef_client.png

Doc Repositories
=====================================================
There are two document repositories for Chef, one that contains the docs and another that contains image files for quick references.

chef-docs
-----------------------------------------------------
All of the documentation for Chef can be found here:

https://github.com/opscode/chef-docs

quick-reference
-----------------------------------------------------
Two large PNG images (front and back) and a smaller single-page image for a Knife Quick Reference can be found here:

https://github.com/opscode/quick-reference

Localization
=====================================================
Sphinx supports localization into many languages.

.pot files
-----------------------------------------------------
.pot files are used by localization teams as an intermediate step in-between the native English content and the localized content. Opscode needs to build the .pot files so that localization teams can feed them into their tools as part of their localization process.

The .pot file is built using much the same process as a regular Sphinx content build. For example, a regular content build:

.. code-block:: bash

   sphinx-build -b html /path/to/source /path/to/build

and then for the .pot files:

.. code-block:: bash

   sphinx-build -b gettext /path/to/source /path/to/translate

with the very important difference of the ``/build`` vs. ``/translate`` folders for the output.

.pot files should be checked into the github repository like every other source file and even though they are output of the source files, should be treated as if they are source files.

.. note:: The /translate folder in the github source contains a regularly updated set of .pot files. That said, it is recommended that if you want to localize the Chef documentation, check with Opscode (send email to docs@opscode.com) and let us know that you want to participate in the localization process and we can sync up. Or just update the .pot files locally to make sure they are the most current versions of the .pot files.

Custom Configuration Settings (conf.py)
=====================================================
Every Sphinx build has a configuration file.

rst_prolog
-----------------------------------------------------
Opscode has added this configuration setting to every conf.py file to help streamline the inclusion of files at the beginning of the build process and to help support localization efforts. This setting is added to the general configuration settings and looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

   # A string of reStructuredText that will be included at the beginning of every source file that is read.
   rst_prolog = """
   .. include:: ../../swaps/swap_desc_a.txt
