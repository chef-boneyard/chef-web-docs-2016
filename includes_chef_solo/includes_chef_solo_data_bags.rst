A data bag is defined using |json|. |chef solo| will look for data bags in ``/var/chef/data_bags``, but this location can be modified by changing the setting in |solo rb| For example, the following setting in |solo rb|:

.. code-block:: ruby

   data_bag_path "/var/chef-solo/data_bags"

Create a data bag by creating folders. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir /var/chef-solo/data_bags

and:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir /var/chef-solo/data_bags/admins

and then create a |json| file in that location:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "id": "ITEM_NAME"
   }

where the name of the file is the ``ITEM_NAME``, for example::

   /var/chef-solo/data_bags/admins/ITEM_NAME.json
