The GET method is used to get a listing of the available cookbooks..

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``start``
     - The offset into a list of cookbooks, at which point the list of cookbooks will begin.
   * - ``items``
     - The number of items to be returned as a result of the request.

.. note:: Using ``items`` and ``start`` can be helpful when the number of cookbooks returned is more than what is easily viewable in the returned list of cookbooks.

**Request**

.. code-block:: ruby

   GET /cookbooks?start=START&items=ITEMS

**Response**

The response will return the name of the cookbook, a description, URI, the name of the individual who maintains the cookbook. In addition, the total number of cookbooks on |api cookbooks site| is shown, as well (if ``start`` is specified) the point at which the list of returned cookbooks began:
