A role is a way to define certain patterns and processes that exist across nodes in a Chef organization as belonging to a single job function. Each role consists of one (or more) attributes and a run list. Each node can have one (or more) roles assigned to it. When a role is run against a node the configuration details of that node are compared against the attributes of the role, and then the contents of that role\(aqs run list are applied to the node\(aqs configuration details. When a chef\-client runs, it merges its own attributes and run lists with those contained within each assigned role.
