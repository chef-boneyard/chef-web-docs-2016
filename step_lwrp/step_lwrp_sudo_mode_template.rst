.. This is an included how-to. 

.. To use the template mode, do something like:

.. code-block:: ruby

   sudo "tomcat"
     # this template must exist in the calling cookbook
     template "restart_tomcat.erb"
     variables( :cmds => [ "/etc/init.d/tomcat restart" ] )
   end

which will generate something like the following in ``/etc/sudoers.d/tomcat``:

.. code-block:: ruby

   # this file was generated by chef
   %tomcat ALL=(app_user) /etc/init.d/tomcat restart
