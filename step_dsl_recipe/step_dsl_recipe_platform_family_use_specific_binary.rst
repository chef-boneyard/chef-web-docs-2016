.. This is an included how-to. 

The following is an example of using the ``platform_family?`` method and an ``if`` statement to ensure that a specific binary is used for a specific platform. In this case, if the platform is |redhat enterprise linux| then use the ``/usr/bin/pip`` binary and for everything else use the ``/usr/local/bin/pip`` binary.

.. code-block:: ruby

   if platform_family?("rhel")
     pip_binary = "/usr/bin/pip"
   else
     pip_binary = "/usr/local/bin/pip"
   end
