   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``:name``
     - The name of the application.
   * - ``:environment_name``
     - The name of the environment.
   * - ``:path``
     - The path to the application.
   * - ``:owner``
     - The system owner that is responsible for the checked-out code.
   * - ``:group``
     - The system group that is responsible for the checked-out code.
   * - ``:strategy``
     - The deploy strategy: ``timestamped_deploy`` or ``deploy_revision`` (default). Use ``deploy_revision`` to ensure that the name of a release sub-directory is based on a revision identifier and puts deployed components under the destination location that is owned by the user who runs the application. For users of |git|, this will be the familiar SHA checksum. For users of |svn|, it will be the integer revision number. If a name other than a revision identifier is provided---branch names, tags, and so on---|chef| will ignore the alternate names and will look up the revision identifier and use it to name the release sub-directory. Use ``timestamped_deploy`` to name a release sub-directory with a timestamp in the form of YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. For example: /my/deploy/dir/releases/20121120162342.
   * - ``:scm_provider``
     - The name of the source control management provider to be used.
   * - ``:revision``
     - The revision to be checked out. This can be symbolic, like ``HEAD`` or it can be a source control management-specific revision identifier.
   * - ``:repository``
     - The name of the sub-directory in which the pristine copy of an applicationâ€™s source is kept.
   * - ``:enable_submodules``
     - |git| only. Use to perform a sub-module initialization and update.
   * - ``:environment``
     - A hash of the form ``{"ENV_VARIABLE"=>"VALUE"}``.
   * - ``:deploy_key``
     - The RSA private key needed to deploy an application.
   * - ``:force``
     - 
   * - ``:rollback_on_error``
     - Indicates whether a deploy resource will rollback to a previously-deployed release if an error occurs when deploying a new release.
   * - ``:purge_before_symlink``
     - An array of paths, relative to the application root, that are to be removed from a checkout before symbolic linking.
   * - ``:create_dirs_before_symlink``
     - The directories to create before symbolic linking. This runs after ``purge_before_symlink``.
   * - ``:symlinks``
     - A hash that maps files in a shared directory to their paths in the current release.
   * - ``:symlink_before_migrate``
     - A hash that maps files in a shared directory into the current release. Runs before migration.
   * - ``:migrate``
     - Indicates that the migration command will be run.
   * - ``:migration_command``
     - A string that contains a shell command that can be executed to run a migration operation.
