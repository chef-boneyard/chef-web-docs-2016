The |resource script| resource is used to execute using the specified interpreter (|bash|, |csh|, |perl|, |python|, or |ruby|). This resource includes all of the actions and attributes that are available to the |resource execute| resource. The |ruby| script resource is different from the |resource ruby block| resource because |ruby| run with the |resource script| resource is created as a temporary file and executed like other script resources, rather than run inline. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` meta parameters to guard the use of this resource for idempotence.
