Use the |resource directory| resource to manage a directory, which is a hierarchy of folders that comprises all of the information stored on a computer. The root directory is the top-level, under which the rest of the directory is organized. The |resource directory| resource uses the ``name`` property to specify the path to a location in a directory. Typically, permission to access that location in the directory is required.
