The syntax for using the git resource in a recipe is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   git "name" do
     some_attribute "value" # see attributes section below
     ...
     action :action # see actions section below
   end

where 

* ``git`` tells |chef| to use the ``Chef::Provider::Git`` provider during the |chef| run.
* ``"name"`` is the location in which the source files will be placed and/or synchronized with the files under source control management
* ``attribute`` is zero (or more) of the attributes that are available for this resource
* ``:action`` is the step that the resource will ask the provider to take during the |chef| run

The following is an example shows the git resource:

.. code-block:: ruby

   git "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/app_name" do
     repository node[:app_name][:git_repository]
     reference node[:app_name][:git_revision]
     action :sync
     notifies :run, "bash[compile_app_name]"
   end

where

* the name of the resource is ``#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/libvpx``
* the ``repository`` and ``reference`` nodes tell |chef| which repository and revision to use
