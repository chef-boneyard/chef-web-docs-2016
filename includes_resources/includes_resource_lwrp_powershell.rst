The |lwrp powershell| lightweight resource is used to execute a script using the |windows powershell| interpreter (similar to script resources for |bash|, |csh|, |perl|, |python|, or |ruby|). A temporary file is created and executed like other script resources, rather than run in-line. A |windows powershell| lightweight resource is not idempotent. Use the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` meta parameters to guard the use of this resource for idempotence.
