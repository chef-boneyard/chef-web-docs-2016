The syntax for using the |resource cron| resource in a recipe is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   cron "name" do
     some_attribute "value" # see attributes section below
     ...
     action :action # see actions section below
   end

where 

* ``cron`` tells |chef| to use the ``Chef::Provider::Cron`` provider during the |chef| run
* ``"name"`` is the name of the cron entry
* ``attribute`` is zero (or more) of the attributes that are available for this resource
* ``:action`` is the step that the resource will ask the provider to take during the |chef| run

For example, the following will run every hour at 8:00 every Saturday morning, sending an email to "admin@opscode.com" every time it runs.

.. code-block:: ruby

   cron "name_of_cron_entry" do
     hour 8
     weekday 6
     mailto admin@opscode.com
     action :create
   end

The following example will run at 8:00 PM, every weekday (Monday through Friday), but only in November:

.. code-block:: ruby

   cron "name_of_cron_entry" do
     minute 0
     hour 20
     day *
     month 10
     weekday 1-5
     action :create
   end
