The ``new_resource`` method is used to represent a resource as loaded by the |chef client| during the |chef client| run. In other words: what the resource should be. The custom provider should compare the resource as it exists on the node to the resource that is created during the |chef client| run to determine what steps need to be taken to bring the resource into the desired state.

For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   action :delete do
     if ::File.exists?(new_resource.path)
       converge_by("deleting #{new_resource.path}) do
         if ::File.writable?(new_resource.path)
           Chef::Log.info("Deleting #{new_resource} at #{new_resource.path}")
           ::File.delete(new_resource.path)
         else
           raise "Cannot delete #{new_resource} at #{new_resource.path}!"
         end
       end
     end
   end

where the |chef client| checks to see if the file exists, then if the file is writable, and then attempts to delete the resource. ``path`` is an attribute of the new resource that is defined by the lightweight resource.
