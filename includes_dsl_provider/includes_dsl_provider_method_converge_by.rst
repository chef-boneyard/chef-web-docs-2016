The ``converge_by`` method is a wrapper that is used to tell the |chef client| what do if a resource is run in |whyrun| mode. The syntax for the ``converge_by`` method is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   converge_by("message")

where:

* ``converge_by()`` is added to an ``action`` block as a wrapper
* ``"message"`` is the message that the |chef client| returns when it is run in |whyrun| mode

Some examples:

.. code-block:: ruby

   converge_by("Create directory #{ @new_resource.path }")

.. code-block:: ruby

   converge_by("Create user #{ @new_resource }")

.. code-block:: ruby

   converge_by("attach volume with aws_id=#{vol[:aws_id]} id=#{instance_id} device=#{new_resource.device} and update") do

.. code-block:: ruby

   description = "create dir #{app_root} and change owner to #{new_resource.owner}"
   converge_by(description) do
     FileUtils.mkdir app_root, :mode => new_resource.app_home_mode
     FileUtils.chown new_resource.owner, new_resource.owner, app_root
   end

where the last example shows using a variable (``description``) as the ``"message"`` in the ``converge_by`` block.

An example of the ``converge_by`` method being used in the `directory <https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/provider/directory.rb>`_ provider, which is a platform resource:

.. code-block:: ruby

   def whyrun_supported?
     true
   end
   
   ...
   
   def action_create
     unless ::File.exist?(@new_resource.path)
       converge_by("create new directory #{@new_resource.path}") do 
         if @new_resource.recursive == true
           ::FileUtils.mkdir_p(@new_resource.path)
         else
           ::Dir.mkdir(@new_resource.path)
         end
         Chef::Log.info("#{@new_resource} created directory #{@new_resource.path}")
       end 
     end
     set_all_access_controls
     update_new_file_state
   end

.. note:: |whyrun| mode is already enabled for platform resources. When platform resources are used as part of the ``action`` block in a lightweight provider, only the ``whyrun_supported?`` is required to allow the |chef client| to run in |whyrun| mode.
