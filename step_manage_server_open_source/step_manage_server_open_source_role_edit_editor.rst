You can edit the override attributes of a role, to override the values of an included recipe or role, and you can edit the default attributes of a role to specify attributes that do not exist in included recipes and roles. To do this, click **json** from the **Default and Override Attributes** tree on the bottom left. Then, click the **Editor** tab on the right, click the green add button under the **Editor** tab, enter a name as the key and a body as the value and click **Add Attribute**.
