.. This is an included how-to. 

To view the contents of a specific cookbook:

#. Log on to the **Management Console**.
#. Click **Cookbooks** on the main navigation menu.
#. Click the link of the cookbook you want to view. This may take longer for very large cookbooks.

#. Click on **Library Files**, **Attribute Files**, **Definition Files**, **Recipe Files**, or **Template Files** to view the contents of the cookbook. If you do not see one of these links, the cookbook does not have files of that type.
