Release Notes: |chef client| 12.0
=====================================================

.. include:: ../../includes_chef/includes_chef.rst

Please `view the notes <http://docs.chef.io/upgrade_client_notes.html>`__ for more background on the upgrade process from |chef client| 11 to |chef client| 12.

What's New
=====================================================
The following items are new for |chef client| 12.0 and/or are changes from previous versions. The short version:

* **Ruby 2.0 (or higher) for Windows; and Ruby 2.1 (or higher) for Unix/Linux** |ruby| versions 1.8.7, 1.9.1, 1.9.2, and 1.9.3 are no longer supported. See `this blog post <https://www.chef.io/blog/2014/11/25/ruby-1-9-3-eol-and-chef-12/>`_ for more info.
* **The number of changes between Ruby 1.9 and 2.0 is small** Please review the `Ruby 2.0 release notes <https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v2_0_0_0/NEWS>`_ or `Ruby 2.1 release notes <https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v2_1_0/NEWS>`_ for the full list of changes.
* **provides method for building custom resources** Use the ``provides`` method to associate a custom resource with a built-in |chef client| resource and to specify platforms on which the custom resource may be used.
* **The chef-client supports the AIX platform** The |chef client| may now be used to configure nodes that are running on the |ibm aix| platform, versions 6.1 (TL6 or higher, recommended) and 7.1 (TL0 SP3 or higher, recommended). The |resource service| resource supports starting, stopping, and restarting services that are managed by |ibm aix_src|, as well as managing all service states with |berkeley os|-based init systems. 
* **New bff_package resource** Use the |resource package_bff| resource to install packages on the |ibm aix| platform.
* **New homebrew_package resource** Use the |resource package_homebrew| resource to install packages on the |mac os x| platform. The |resource package_homebrew| resource also replaces the |resource package_macports| resource as the default package installer on the |mac os x| platform.
* **New reboot resource** Use the |resource reboot| resource to reboot a node during or at the end of a |chef client| run.
* **New windows_service resource** Use the |resource service_windows| resource to manage services on the |windows| platform.
* **New --bootstrap-template option** Use the ``--bootstrap-template`` option to install the |chef client| with a bootstrap template. Specify the name of a template, such as ``chef-full``, or specify the path to a custom bootstrap template. This option deprecates the ``--distro`` and ``--template-file`` options.
* **New SSL options for bootstrap operations** The |subcommand knife bootstrap| subcommand has new options that support |ssl| with bootstrap operations. Use the ``--[no-]node-verify-api-cert`` option to to perform |ssl| validation of the connection to the |chef server|. Use the ``--node-ssl-verify-mode`` option to validate |ssl| certificates.
* **New format options for knife status** Use the ``--medium`` and ``--long`` options to include attributes in the output and to format that output as |json|.
* **New fsck_device property for mount resource** The |resource mount| resource supports |fsck| devices for the |solaris| platform with the ``fsck_device`` property.
* **New settings for metadata.rb** The |metadata rb| file has two new settings: ``issues_url`` and ``source_url``. These settings are used to capture the source location and issues tracking location for a cookbook. These settings are also used with |supermarket|. In addition, the ``name`` setting is now **required**.
* **The http_request GET and HEAD requests drop the hard-coded query string** |http_request query_string|
* **New Recipe DSL methods** The |dsl recipe| has three new methods: ``shell_out``, ``shell_out!``, and ``shell_out_with_systems_locale``.
* **File specificity updates** File specificity for the |resource template| and |resource cookbook_file| resources now supports using the ``source`` attribute to define an explicit lookup path as an array.
* **Improved user password security for the user resource, Mac OS X platform** The |resource user| resource now supports salted password hashes for |mac os x| 10.7 (and higher). Use the ``iterations`` and ``salt`` attributes to calculate SALTED-SHA512 password shadow hashes for |mac os x| version 10.7 and SALTED-SHA512-PBKDF2 password shadow hashes for version 10.8 (and higher).
* **data_bag_item method in the Recipe DSL supports encrypted data bag items** Use ``data_bag_item(bag_name, item, secret)`` to specify the secret to use for an encrypted data bag item. |secret_config|
* **value_for_platform method in the Recipe DSL supports version constraints** Version constraints---``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=``, ``~>``---may be used when specifying a version. An exception is raised if two version constraints match. An exact match will always take precedence over a match made from a version constraint.
* **knife cookbook site share supports --dry-run** Use the ``--dry-run`` option with the |subcommand knife site cookbook| to take no action and only print out results.
* **chef-client configuration setting updates** The |chef client| now supports running an override run-list (via the ``--override-runlist`` option) without clearing the cookbook cache on the node. In addition, the ``--chef-zero-port`` option allows specifying a range of ports.
* **Unforked interval runs are no longer allowed** The ``--[no-]fork`` option may no longer be used in the same command with the ``--daemonize`` and ``--interval`` options.
* **Splay and interval values are applied before the chef-client run** The ``--interval`` and ``--splay`` values are applied before the |chef client| run when using the |chef client| and |chef solo| executables.
* **All files and templates in a cookbook are synchronized at the start of the chef-client run** The ``no_lazy_load`` configuration setting in the |client rb| file now defaults to ``true``. This avoids issues where time-sensitive URLs in a cookbook manifest timeout before the |resource cookbook_file| or |resource template| resources converged.
* **File staging now defaults to the destination directory by default** Staging into a system's temporary directory---typically ``/tmp`` or ``/var/tmp``---as opposed to the destination directory may cause issues with permissions, available space, or cross-device renames. Files are now staged to the destination directory by default.
* **Partial search updates** Use ``:filter_result`` to build search results into a |ruby hash|. This replaces the previous functionality that was provided by the ``partial_search`` cookbook, albeit with a different API. Use the ``--filter-result`` option to return only attributes that match the specified filter. For example: ``\"ServerName=name, Kernel=kernel.version\"``.
* **Client-side key generation is enabled by default** When a new |chef client| is created using the validation client account, the |chef server| allows the |chef client| to generate a key-pair locally, and then send the public key to the |chef server|. This behavior is controlled by the ``local_key_generation`` attribute in the |client rb| file and now defaults to ``true``. 
* **New guard_interpreter property defaults** The ``guard_interpreter`` property now defaults to ``:batch`` for the |resource batch| resource and ``:powershell_script`` for the |resource powershell_script| resource.
* **Events are sent to the Application event log on the Windows platform by default** Events are sent to the |windows| "Application" event log at the start and end of a |chef client| run, and also if a |chef client| run fails. Set the ``disable_event_logger`` configuration setting in the |client rb| file to ``true`` to disable event logging.
* **The installer_type property for the windows_package resource uses a symbol instead of a string** Previous versions of the |chef client| (starting with version 11.8) used a string.
* **The path property is deprecated for the execute resource** Use the ``environment`` property instead.
* **Attribute behavior changes** Please `see RFC-23 for important changes to attributes <https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc023-chef-12-attributes-changes.md>`_ in |chef client| 12, including how to delete an attribute key for a specific precedence level, how to delete an attribute key for all precedence levels, and how to overwrite the nested value at a specific precedence level. In addition, ``node.default!`` is now ``node.force_default`` and ``node.override!`` is now ``node.force_override``.
* **SSL certificate validation improvements** The default settings for |ssl| certificate validation now default in favor of validation. In addition, using the |subcommand knife ssl_fetch| command is now an important part of setting up your workstation.
* **New property for git resource** The |resource scm_git| resource has a new property: ``environment``, which takes a |ruby hash| of environment variables in the form of ``{"ENV_VARIABLE" => "VALUE"}``.

provides Method
-----------------------------------------------------
.. include:: ../../includes_dsl_resource/includes_dsl_resource_method_provides.rst

|ibm aix| Platform Support
-----------------------------------------------------
The |chef client| may now be used to configure nodes that are running on the |ibm aix| platform, versions 6.1 (TL6 or higher, recommended) and 7.1 (TL0 SP3 or higher, recommended). The |resource service| resource supports starting, stopping, and restarting services that are managed by |ibm aix_src|, as well as managing all service states with |berkeley os|-based init systems.

**System Requirements**

The |chef client| has the `same system requirements <http://docs.chef.io/chef_system_requirements.html#chef-client>`_ on the |ibm aix| platform as any other platform, with the following notes:

* Expand the file system on the |ibm aix| platform using ``chfs`` or by passing the ``-X`` flag to ``installp`` to automatically expand the logical partition (LPAR)
* The EN_US (UTF-8) character set should be installed on the logical partition prior to installing the |chef client| (see below)

**Install the chef-client on the AIX platform**

The |chef client| is distributed as a |ibm aix_bff| binary and is installed on the |ibm aix| platform using the following command run as a root user:

.. code-block:: text

   # installp -aYgd chef-12.0.0-1.powerpc.bff all

**Increase system process limits**

The out-of-the-box system process limits for maximum process memory size (RSS) and number of open files are typically too low to run the |chef client| on a logical partition (LPAR). When the system process limits are too low, the |chef client| will not be able to create threads. To increase the system process limits:

#. Validate that the system process limits have not already been increased.
#. If they have not been increased, run the following commands as a root user:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chsec -f /etc/security/limits -s default -a "rss=-1"

   and then:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chsec -f /etc/security/limits -s default -a "nofiles=50000"

#. Reboot the logical partition (LPAR) to apply the updated system process limits.

When the system process limits are too low, an error is returned similar to:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Error Syncing Cookbooks:
   ==================================================================
   
   Unexpected Error:
   -----------------
   ThreadError: can't create Thread: Resource temporarily unavailable


**Install the UTF-8 character set**

.. include:: ../../includes_install/includes_install_chef_client_aix_en_us.rst

**New providers**

The |resource service| resource has two new providers:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 150 80 320
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Long name
     - Short name
     - Notes
   * - ``Chef::Provider::Service::Aix``
     - ``service``
     - The provider that is used with the |ibm aix| platforms. Use the ``service`` short name to start, stop, and restart services with |ibm aix_src|.
   * - ``Chef::Provider::Service::AixInit``
     - ``service``
     -  The provider that is used to manage |berkeley os|-based init services on |ibm aix|.

``knife bootstrap`` Settings
-----------------------------------------------------
The following options are new:

``--[no-]node-verify-api-cert``
   |ssl_verify_mode_verify_api_cert| If this option is not specified, the setting for ``verify_api_cert`` in the configuration file is applied.

``--node-ssl-verify-mode PEER_OR_NONE``
   |ssl_verify_mode|
 
   |ssl_verify_bootstrap_none|

   |ssl_verify_bootstrap_peer| This is the recommended setting.

``-t TEMPLATE``, ``--bootstrap-template TEMPLATE``
   |template bootstrap| Default value: ``chef-full``, which installs the |chef client| using the |omnibus installer| on all supported platforms.

   .. note:: The ``--distro`` and ``--template-file`` options are deprecated.


``knife status`` Settings
-----------------------------------------------------
The following options are new:

``-l``, ``--long``
   |long|

``-m``, ``--medium``
   |medium|


``fsck_device`` Property
-----------------------------------------------------
The following property is new for the |resource mount| resource:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 150 450
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description
   * - ``fsck_device``
     - |fsck_device| Default value: ``-``.

|metadata rb| Settings
-----------------------------------------------------
The following settings are new:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - ``issues_url``
     - |url cookbook_issues| For example:

       .. code-block:: ruby

          source_url "https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-client/issues"

   * - ``source_url``
     - |url cookbook_source| For example:

       .. code-block:: ruby

          source_url "https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-client"

.. warning:: The ``name`` attribute is now a required setting in the |metadata rb| file.

http_request Actions
-----------------------------------------------------
|http_request query_string|

|dsl recipe|
-----------------------------------------------------
The following methods have been added to the |dsl recipe|: ``shell_out``, ``shell_out!``, and ``shell_out_with_systems_locale``.

``shell_out``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. include:: ../../includes_dsl_recipe/includes_dsl_recipe_method_shell_out.rst

``shell_out!``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. include:: ../../includes_dsl_recipe/includes_dsl_recipe_method_shell_out_bang.rst

``shell_out_with_systems_locale``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. include:: ../../includes_dsl_recipe/includes_dsl_recipe_method_shell_out_with_systems_locale.rst

``value_for_platform``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The ``value_for_platform`` helper may use version constraints, such as ``>=`` and ``~>`` to help resolve situations where version numbers look like ``7.0.<buildnumber>``. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   value_for_platform(
     "redhat" => {
       "~> 7.0" => "version 7.x.y"
       ">= 8.0" => "version 8.0.0 and greater"
     }
   }

.. note:: When two version constraints match it is considered ambiguous and will raise an exception. An exact match, however, will always take precedence over a version constraint.

File Specificity
-----------------------------------------------------
The pattern for file specificity depends on two things: the lookup path and the source attribute. The first pattern that matches is used:

#. /host-$fqdn/$source
#. /$platform-$platform_version/$source
#. /$platform/$source
#. /default/$source
#. /$source

Use an array with the ``source`` attribute to define an explicit lookup path. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   file '/conf.py' do
     source ["#{node.chef_environment}.py", 'conf.py']
   end

or:

.. code-block:: ruby

   template '/test' do
     source ["#{node.chef_environment}.erb", 'default.erb']
   end


|mac os x|, Passwords
-----------------------------------------------------
The following properties are new for the |resource user| resource:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 150 450
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description
   * - ``iterations``
     - |iterations|
   * - ``salt``
     - |salt| |mac os x| version 10.7 uses SALTED-SHA512 and version 10.8 (and higher) uses SALTED-SHA512-PBKDF2 to calculate password shadow hashes. 

**Use SALTED-SHA512 passwords**

.. include:: ../../step_resource/step_resource_user_password_shadow_hash_salted_sha512.rst

**Use SALTED-SHA512-PBKDF2 passwords**

.. include:: ../../step_resource/step_resource_user_password_shadow_hash_salted_sha512_pbkdf2.rst


|chef client| Options
-----------------------------------------------------
The following options are updated for the |chef client| executable:

``--chef-zero-port PORT``
   |port chef_zero| If a port is not specified---individually or as range of ports from within the command---the |chef client| will scan for ports between 8889-9999 and will pick the first port that is available. This port or port range may also be specified using the ``chef_zero.port`` setting in the |client rb| file.

``-o RUN_LIST_ITEM``, ``--override-runlist RUN_LIST_ITEM``
   |override_runlist| This option will not clear the list of cookbooks (and related files) that is cached on the node.

The following configuration settings are updated for the |client rb| file and now default to ``true``:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - ``disable_event_logger``
     - |disable event_logging_windows| Default value: ``true``.
   * - ``no_lazy_load``
     - |no_lazy_load| Default value: ``true``.
   * - ``file_staging_uses_destdir``
     - |file_staging_uses_destdir| Default value: ``true``.
   * - ``local_key_generation``
     - Use to specify whether the |chef server| or |chef client| will generate the private/public key pair. When ``true``, the |chef client| will generate the key pair, and then send the public key to the |chef server|. Default value: ``true``.


Filter Search Results
-----------------------------------------------------
.. include:: ../../includes_dsl_recipe/includes_dsl_recipe_method_search_filter_result.rst

knife search
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The |subcommand knife search| subcommand allows filtering search results with a new option:

``-f FILTER``, ``--filter-result FILTER``
   Use to return only attributes that match the specified ``FILTER``. For example: ``\"ServerName=name, Kernel=kernel.version\"``.

|resource execute| Resource, ``path`` Property
-----------------------------------------------------
.. include:: ../../includes_resources_common/includes_resources_common_resource_execute_attribute_path.rst

|resource scm_git| Property
-----------------------------------------------------
The following property is new for the |resource scm_git| resource:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description
   * - ``environment``
     - |environment variables|

       .. note:: The |resource scm_git| provider automatically sets the ``ENV['HOME']`` and ``ENV['GIT_SSH']`` environment variables. To override this behavior and provide different values, add ``ENV['HOME']`` and/or ``ENV['GIT_SSH']`` to the ``environment`` |ruby hash|.

.. include:: ../../includes_dsl_provider/includes_dsl_provider_method_updated_by_last_action_example.rst

Attribute Behavior Changes
-----------------------------------------------------
Please `see RFC-23 for important changes to attributes <https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc023-chef-12-attributes-changes.md>`_ in |chef client| 12, including how to delete an attribute key for a specific precedence level, how to delete an attribute key for all precedence levels, and how to overwrite the nested value at a specific precedence level. In addition, ``node.default!`` is now ``node.force_default`` and ``node.override!`` is now ``node.force_override``.
