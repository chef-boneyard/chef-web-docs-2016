The short version of why |company_name| chose the |apache| license for |chef| is because we defined three broad requirements for a license under which we would release open source software:

* We are an open source company and we make money from our open source software so we wanted a license that allowed us to build a business from the things we created
* We wanted anyone (or any company) whose problems were solved by our software to be able to use it, in any environment they wanted, in whatever way they wanted
* We wanted to build an open and equal community of users and did not want to reserve any rights for ourselves that we didn’t grant to the all of the other people (and companies) who helped build our software
