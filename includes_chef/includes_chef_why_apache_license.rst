The short version is that we had three broad requirements for the license under which we would release open source software:

* We are an open source company. We make money from our open source software. We wanted a license that allowed us to build a business from the things we created
* We wanted anyone (or any company) whose problems were solved by our software to be able to use it, in any environment they wanted, in whatever way they wanted
* We wanted to build an open and equal community of users. We did not want to reserve any rights for ourselves that we didnâ€™t grant to the all of the other people (and companies) who helped build our software
