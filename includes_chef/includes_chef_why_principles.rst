The key underlying principle of |chef| is that you (the user) knows best about what your environment is, what it should do, and how it should be maintained. |chef| is designed to not make assumptions about any of those things. Only the individuals on the ground---that's you and your team---understand the technical problems and what is required to solve them. Only your team can understand the human problems (skill levels, audit trails, and other internal issues) that are unique to your organization and whether any single technical solution is viable.
