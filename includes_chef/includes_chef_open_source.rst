The open source |chef server| is a free version of the |chef server| that contains much of the same functionality as |chef hosted|, but requires that each instance be configured and managed locally, including performing data migrations, applying updates to the open source |chef server|, and ensuring that the open source |chef server| scales as the local infrastructure it is supporting grows. The open source |chef server| includes support from the |chef| community, but does not include support directly from |opscode|.
