|chef| is a systems and cloud infrastructure automation framework that makes it easy to deploy servers and applications to any physical, virtual, or cloud location, no matter the size of the infrastructure. Each |chef| organization is comprised of one (or more) workstations, a single server, and as many nodes as are required. Cookbooks (and recipes) are used to tell |chef| how each node in your organization should be configured.
