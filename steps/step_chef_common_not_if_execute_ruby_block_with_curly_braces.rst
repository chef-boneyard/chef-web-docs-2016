.. This is an included how-to. 


The following example shows how to use a |ruby| block (with curly braces) to create ``/tmp/somefile``, but not if the ``/etc/passwd`` already exists:

.. code-block:: ruby

   template "/tmp/somefile" do
     mode "0644"
     source "somefile.erb"
     not_if {File.exists?("/etc/passwd")}
   end
