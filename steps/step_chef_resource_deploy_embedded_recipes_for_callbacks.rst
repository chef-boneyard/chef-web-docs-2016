.. This is an included how-to. 

To use embedded recipes for callbacks:
Using resources from within your callbacks as blocks or within callback files distributed with your application's source code

.. code-block:: ruby

   deploy "#{node[:tmpdir]}/deploy" do
     repo "#{node[:tmpdir]}/gitrepo/typo/"
     environment "RAILS_ENV" => "production"
     revision "HEAD"
     action :deploy
     migration_command "rake db:migrate --trace"
     migrate true
      
     # Callback awesomeness:
     before_migrate do
       current_release = release_path
       
       directory "#{current_release}/deploy" do
         mode "0755"
       end
     
       # creates a callback for before_symlink
       template "#{current_release}/deploy/before_symlink_callback.rb" do
         source "embedded_recipe_before_symlink.rb.erb"
         mode "0644"
       end
      
     end
      
     # This file can contain Chef recipe code, plain ruby also works
     before_symlink "deploy/before_symlink_callback.rb"
      
     restart do
       current_release = release_path
       file "#{release_path}/tmp/restart.txt" do
         mode "0644"
       end
     end
