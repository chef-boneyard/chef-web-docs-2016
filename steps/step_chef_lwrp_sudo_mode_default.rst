.. This is an included how-to. 

To use the natural (default) mode, do something like:

.. code-block:: ruby

   sudo "tomcat" do
     user "%tomcat" # or a username
     runas "app_user" # or "app_user : tomcat"
     commands ["/etc/init.d/tomcat restart"] # array of commands, will be .join(",")
     host "ALL"
     nopasswd false # true prepends the runas_spec with NOPASSWD
   end

to generate the following in ``/etc/sudoers.d/tomcat``:

.. code-block:: ruby

   # this file was generated by chef
   %tomcat ALL=(app_user) /etc/init.d/tomcat restart
