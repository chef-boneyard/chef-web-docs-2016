.. This is an included how-to. 


To create a cookbook (including all default components), run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife cookbook create COOKBOOK_NAME

where ``COOKBOOK_NAME`` is the name of the cookbook that will be created. Any un-needed directory components can be left unused or deleted, if preferred.
