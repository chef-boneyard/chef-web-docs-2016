.. This is an included how-to. 

To install Dropbox. Uses volumes_dir because the mounted directory is different than the name of the application directory. Installs in /Applications/Dropbox.app.

.. code-block:: ruby

   dmg_package "Dropbox" do
      volumes_dir "Dropbox Installer"
      source "http://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=mac"
      checksum "b4ea620ca22b0517b75753283ceb82326aca8bc3c86212fbf725de6446a96a13"
      action :install
    end

The following examples all use the SHA256 checksum that was current when the application was originally installed, and may not be current for the latest releases.
