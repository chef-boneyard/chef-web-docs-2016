.. This is an included how-to. 


A customer record is stored in an attribute file that looks like this::

   mycompany_customers({
     :bob => {
       :homedir => "/home/bob",
       :webdir => "/home/bob/web"
     }
   }
   )

If there are many customer records in an environment, a simple recipe can be used to loop over every customer, like this::

   all_customers do |name, info|
     directory info[:webdir] do
       owner name
       group name
       action :create
     end
   end

A simple library could be created that extends ``Chef::Recipe::``, like this::

   class Chef
     class Recipe
       def all_customers(&block)
         node[:mycompany_customers].each do |name, info|
           block.call(name, info)
         end
       end
     end
   end
