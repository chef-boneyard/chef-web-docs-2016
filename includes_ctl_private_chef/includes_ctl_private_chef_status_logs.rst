A typical status line for a service that is running in |chef private| in a |tiered| or |standalone| topology is similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   run: name_of_service: (pid 1486) 7819s; run: log: (pid 1485) 7819s

where:

* ``run`` describes the state in which the supervisor attempts to keep processes. This state is either ``run`` or ``down``. If a service is in a ``down`` state, it should be stopped
* ``name_of_service`` is the service name, for example: ``opscode-solr``
* ``(pid 1486) 7819s;`` is the process identifier followed by the amount of time (in seconds) the service has been running
* ``run: log: (pid 1485) 7819s`` is the log process. It is typical for a log process to have a longer run time than a service; this is because the supervisor does not need to restart the log process in order to connect the supervised process

If the service is down, the status line will appear similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   down: opscode-solr: 3s, normally up; run: log: (pid 1485) 8526s

where

* ``down`` indicates that the service is in a down state
* ``3s, normally up;`` indicates that the service is normally in a run state and that the supervisor would attempt to restart this service after a reboot
