.. This is an included how-to. 


Once the workstation is configured, it can be used to install |chef| on one (or more) nodes across the organization using a |knife| bootstrap operation. The ``knife bootstrap`` command is used to |ssh| into the target machine, and then do what is needed to allow the |chef client| to run on the node. It will install the |chef client| executable (if necessary), generate keys, and register the node with the |chef server|. The bootstrap operation requires the IP address or |fully qualified domain name| of the target system, the |ssh| credentials (username, password or identity file) for an account that has root access to the node, and (if the operating system is not |ubuntu|, which is the default distribution used by ``knife bootstrap``) the operating system running on the target system.

To install |chef| on a node using ``knife bootstrap``:

#. In a command window, enter the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ knife bootstrap 123.45.6.789 -x username -P password --sudo

   where ``123.45.6.789`` is the IP address or the FQDN for the node.

#. While the bootstrap operation is running, the command window will show something like the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

      Bootstrapping Chef on 123.45.6.789
      123.45.6.789 knife sudo password: 
      Enter your password:

#. When the bootstrap operation is finished, enter the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ knife client show name_of_client

   where ``name_of_client`` is the name of the client node that was just bootstrapped. The |chef server| will return something similar to:

   .. code-block:: bash

         admin:       false
         chef_type:   client
         json_class:  Chef::ApiClient
         name:        name_of_client
         public_key: 

   This verifies that the node is recognized by the |chef server|.
