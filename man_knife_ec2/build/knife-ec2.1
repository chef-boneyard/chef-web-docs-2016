Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud based and pre\-configured operating system and virtual application software using Amazon Machine Images (AMI). The \fBec2\fP sub\-command is used to manage API\-driven cloud servers that are hosted by Amazon EC2.
.sp
This plugin is available on github: \fI\%https://github.com/opscode/knife-ec2\fP.
.IP Note
This plugin requires the \fBknife windows\fP plugin to be present on the same machine: \fI\%https://github.com/opscode/knife-windows\fP.

This sub\-command has the following syntax:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
knife ec2 [ARGUMENT] (options)
.ft P
.fi
.SH INSTANCE DATA
.sp
The \fBinstance data\fP argument is used to generate instance metadata used with custom Opscode Amazon Machine Images (AMI). This process will read the validation certificate and Chef server URL from the Knife configuration file (~/.chef/knife.rb) and will output the data in JSON format.
.IP Note
Using this sub\-command is an older way of launching Amazon EC2 instances for Chef and should be considered deprecated. Using the \fBserver create\fP sub\-command is preferred (and more flexible). Although this sub\-command will remain, the Opscode custom Amazon Machine Images (AMI) are out of date.
