.. This is an included how-to. 

The following example shows how to use a case statement to check the platform, and for certain platforms send a notification immediately after installing the ``package_b`` package that will generate a module list.


.. code-block:: ruby

   case node[:platform]
     when "debian", "ubuntu"
       package "package_a" do
         action :install
       end
     when "centos", "redhat", "fedora"
       package "package_b" do
         action :install
         notifies :run, resources(:execute => "generate-module-list"), :immediately
       end
   end
