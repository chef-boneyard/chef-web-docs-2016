So what are users?

* A user is typically an individual who interacts with the |chef hosted| or |chef private| servers through the user interface or from a workstation using |knife|
* A user, for the purposes of discussing role-based access control, is also the |chef client|, which requires access to the |chef server| to pull down cookbooks, get the latest node object, update the node object at the end of a |chef| run, and so on
* A user can also be any other entity that requires access to the |chef server|, such as a custom subcommand in a |knife| plugin, a custom |curl| or |ruby| script, a string that is executed using the ``knife exec`` subcommand, and so on

The |chef hosted| and |chef private| servers recognize users based on private keys, where each private key is effectively a user that can send authorization requests via the |api chef server|. The private keys are typically assigned to the |chef client| and to the user of a workstation, from which that user will execute |knife| subcommands and other actions. 

For example, the user of a workstation is an administrator for the |chef server|. That user also uses two custom |knife| plugins and (occasionally) needs ad hoc access to the |chef server| from the command line, sometimes |curl| and sometimes using the ``knife exec`` subcommand. This user can use the same private key for each of these actions and when requests are authorized, the |chef hosted| or |chef private| servers will apply the same role-based access control model to all of those actions.

Effectively, it's the private key that the |chef hosted| and |chef private| servers consider to be "users".

The role-based access control model in the |chef hosted| and |chef private| servers also maps to the common users and groups approach to security, where each user of |chef| can be assigned permissions individually, or each user can be assigned to one (or more) groups.
