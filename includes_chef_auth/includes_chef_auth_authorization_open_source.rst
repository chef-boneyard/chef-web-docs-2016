The open source |chef server| has a single tenant access control model. All objects---roles, nodes, cookbooks, data bags, search indexes, and so on---are stored in the same virtual space and are accessible to any API request (as long as the request can be authorized). All users are granted ``admin``, ``normal``, or ``validator`` rights:

* ``admin`` rights allow tasks such as create, read, update, or delete for all nodes
* ``normal`` rights are only actionable only on per-node basis

The following tables list the various API requests that may be made to the open source |chef server|. Any requests that are not listed can be done as long the API requests is authenticated properly.

The following API requests require admin privileges:
