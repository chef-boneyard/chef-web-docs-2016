Use ``.run_action(:some_action)`` at the end of a resource block to run the specified action during the compile phase. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   resource_name 'foo' do
     action :nothing
   end.run_action(:some_action)

where ``action`` is set to ``:nothing`` to ensure the ``run_action`` is run during the compile phase and not later during the execution phase.

The following examples show when (and when not) to use ``run_action``.

**Update a package cache**

Sometimes it is necessary to ensure that an operating system's package cache is up to date before installing packages. For example, on |debian| or |ubuntu| systems, the |apt| cache should be updated:

.. code-block:: ruby

   if node['apt']['compile_time_update'] && ( !::File.exist?('/var/lib/apt/periodic/update-success-stamp') || !::File.exist?(first_run_file) )
     e = bash 'apt-get-update at compile time' do
       code <<-EOH
         apt-get update
         touch #{first_run_file}
       EOH
       ignore_failure true
       only_if { apt_installed? }
       action :nothing
     end
     e.run_action(:run)
   end

where ``e.run_action(:run)`` tells the |chef client| to run the ``apt-get update`` command during the compile phase. This example can be found in the ``default.rb`` recipe of the `apt cookbook <https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/apt>`_ that is maintained by |company_name|.

**Use the chef_gem resource for Ruby gems**

A very common use case us to install a |gem| during the compile phase so that it will be available to the |chef client| during the execution phase. This is why the |resource chef_gem| resource exists. For example, this:

.. code-block:: ruby

   chef_gem 'foo' do
     action :install
   end

is effectively the same as

.. code-block:: ruby

   gem_package 'foo' do
     action :nothing
   end.run_action(:install)
   Gem.clear_paths

but without needing to define a ``run_action``.

**Notifications will not work**

Resources that are executed during the compile phase cannot notify other resources. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   execute 'ifconfig'
   
   p = package 'vim-enhanced' do
     action :nothing
     notifies :run, 'execute[ifconfig]', :immediately
   end
   p.run_action(:install)

A better approach in this type of situation is to install the package before the resource collection is built to ensure that it is available to other resources later on.
