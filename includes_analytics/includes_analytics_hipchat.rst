.. |hipchat notification| replace:: Hipchat Notification

|hipchat| integration allows |chef analytics| to send real-time event
notifications to a |hipchat| room.

.. note::
   You must have room owner or administrator privileges for the |hipchat| room
   you wish to send notifications to.

.. note::
   |chef analytics| must be able to make HTTPS (port 443) requests to the
   |hipchat| API in order to send notifications. Ensure that your network is
   configured correctly before proceeding.

To begin, get your room ID and room notification token from |hipchat|:

1. Log in to the |hipchat| web interface, e.g. \http://mycompany.hipchat.com/

2. Click on the **Rooms** tab, then click on **My Rooms** and then click on the
   name of your room.

3. Copy the **API ID** from the Room Details tableâ€”this is the room ID.

4. Click on **Tokens** in the left sidebar.

5. In the **Create new token** dialog enter a label in the **Label** field,
   e.g. "|chef analytics|." Ensure that "Send Notification" is selected and
   then click on **Create**.

   The new room notification token will be displayed at the top of the page;
   copy it as well.

#. Log in to |chef analytics| and click on the **Notifications** tab

#. Click on the **+** button, then click on **Hipchat**

   .. image:: ../../images/analytics_hipchat_new_notification.png

   The |hipchat notification| form will appear.

   of **Hipchat Notification:**.

#. Fill out the following fields:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 120 400
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Field
        - Value

      * - HipChat Host
        - Most users should use ``https://api.hipchat.com``. However, if you
          use a self-hosted |hipchat| server, enter its API URL. If you don't
          know it, ask your system administrator.

          .. note::
             The HipChat Host URL **must not** end with ``/v1`` or ``/v2``.
             |chef analytics| will automatically append the correct path to the
             URL according to the **HipChat API version** chosen (see below).

             If the default value when creating a new notification ends in
             ``/v1`` or ``/v2``, remove that part before saving.

      * - Room to send message to
        - Enter the room ID ("API ID") you copied in (3) above.

      * - From (optional)
        - Enter an additional name to appear in |hipchat| with notifications.

      * - Token to use for authentication
        - Enter the room notification token you copied in (5) above.

      * - HipChat API version
        - Most users should choose "2".

      * - Color (optional)
        - Choose a color for the notification. Defaults to yellow.

      * - Notify the room
        - Choose "yes" if you want |hipchat| to alert room participants when
          the room recieves this notification. Otherwise choose "no."

#. Click on **Save**. The new notification will be displayed in the
   Notifications list.

#. Follow the instructions in :ref:`analytics_rules_send_a_notification`
   to create a rule that will trigger the notification you've created.
