An environment is a way to map an organization\(aqs real\-life workflow to what can be configured and managed when using Chef server. Every Chef organization begins with a single environment called the \fB_default\fP environment, which cannot be modified (or deleted). Additional environments can be created, such as production, staging, testing, and development. Generally, an environment is also associated with one (or more) cookbook versions.
.sp
The \fBenvironment\fP sub\-command is used to manage environments within a single organization on the Chef server.
.sp
This sub\-command has the following syntax:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
knife environment [ARGUMENT] (options)
.ft P
.fi
.SH CREATE
.sp
The \fBcreate\fP argument is used to add an environment object to the Chef server. When this argument is run, Knife will open $EDITOR to enable editing of the ENVIRONMENT description field (unless a description is specified as part of the command). When finished, Knife will add the environment to the Chef server.
.sp
This argument has the following syntax:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
knife environment create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \-d DESCRIPTION
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This argument has the following options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-d DESCRIPTION\fP, \fB\-\-description DESCRIPTION\fP
The description of the environment. This value will populate the description field for the environment on the Chef server.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ knife environment create dev \-d "The development environment."
.ft P
.fi
.SH DELETE
.sp
The \fBdelete\fP argument is used to delete an environment from a Chef server.
.sp
This argument has the following syntax:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
knife environment delete ENVIRONMENT_NAME
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This argument does not have any options.
.sp
For example, to delete an environment named "dev", enter:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ knife environment delete dev
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Type \fBY\fP to confirm a deletion.
.SH EDIT
.sp
The \fBedit\fP argument is used to edit the attributes of an environment. When this argument is run, Knife will open $EDITOR to enable editing of ENVIRONMENT attributes. When finished, Knife will update the Chef server with those changes.
.sp
This argument has the following syntax:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
knife environment edit ENVIRONMENT_NAME
.ft P
.fi
.sp
For example, to edit an environment named "devops", enter:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ knife environment edit devops
.ft P
.fi
.SH FROM FILE
.sp
The \fBfrom file\fP argument is used to add or update an environment using a JSON or Ruby DSL description. It must be run with the \fBcreate\fP or \fBedit\fP arguments.
.sp
This argument has the following syntax:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
knife environment [create | edit] from file FILE
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This argument does not have any options.

.sp
.nf

.ft C
$ knife environment edit devops from file "path to file"
