# chef-docs

The source of the Chef Documentation, located at http://docs.opscode.com/

## Setting Up

First, read [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING).

Fork & Clone repo to your own account://

    git clone https://github.com/myusername/chef-docs.git
    # will take a while, repo is ~800MB

You may wish to use [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/) & [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/) (similar to rvm or rbenv), to isolate this Pytohn environment from others, so start out like so:

    mkvirtualenv chef-docs
    workon chef-docs
    echo chef-docs > .venv # personal preference, can hook into other control projects later

If you don't use this and want to install into your system Python, prepend this command with `sudo`:

    pip install sphinx

Will install all the dependencies you should need.

## Building Docs

There's a `Makefile` in the root of the repo, that should have the majority of the tasks you'll ever need.

Run:

    make release

This will build *all* the documentation into HTML, and place it inside `./build/chef/`.
Open `./build/chef/index.html` to view the rendered files locally.

The first time you run the build, it will probably take longer (5-10 min), as it has to generate _every_ file from scratch.
This will also apply if you've run the `make clean` command, which effectively resets your working environment.

Subsequent runs of `make release` should be relatively fast, and you can use subsets named: `master, all, server` to build one part.

## Editing

Edit any RST files as you would any other text file.
Sphinx syntax reference can be found here: http://sphinx-doc.org/

Always make changes on a 'feature' branch in your own fork, so you can always merge back to `master` cleanly.
Here's how this might look:

    git pull origin master
    git pull upstream master
    git checkout --branch my_new_edit
    # make changes to some file
    make all
    # open file(s) changed in a browser, validate success
    git add <filename changed>
    git commit
    # enter a good commit message
    git push origin my_new_edit
    
Once pushed, visit your repo on GitHub, and open a Pull Request against `opscode/chef-docs:master`.
