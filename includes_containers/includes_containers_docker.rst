|docker| is an open-source engine that helps automates the deployment of any working configuration as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container. |docker| packages a container (a working configuration) into a |docker| image, which is then uploaded to the |docker| registry. From there, any node that runs the |docker| engine can launch this image as a new container. |docker| containers can be run anywhere: the same container used by a developer to build and test their code on a laptop can also be run in production, on a virtual machine, a bare-metal server, as part of an |openstack| cluster, and so on.

Using |docker| helps to:

* Simplify the packaging and deployment of applications
* Create versatile, lightweight environments
* Automate testing, continuous integration, and continuous deployment efforts 
* Deploy and scale web applications, databases, and backend services
