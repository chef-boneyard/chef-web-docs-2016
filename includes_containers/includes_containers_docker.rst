|docker| is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any working configuration as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container. |docker| containers can be run anywhere: the same container used by a developer to build and test their code on a laptop can also be run in production, on a virtual machine, a bare-metal server, as part of an |openstack| cluster, and so on. Using |docker| helps

* Automate the packaging and deployment of applications
* Create lightweight, cloud environments
* Automate testing, continuous integration, and continuous deployment efforts
* Deploy and scale web applications, databases, and backend services
