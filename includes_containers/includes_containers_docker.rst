|docker| is an open-source engine that helps automate the deployment of any working configuration as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container. |docker| packages a container (a working configuration) into a |docker| image, which is then uploaded to the |docker| registry. From there, any node that runs the |docker| engine can launch this image as a new container. |docker| containers can be run anywhere. For example the same container used by a developer to build and test their code on a laptop can also be run in production, on a virtual machine, a bare-metal server, and as part of an |openstack| cluster.
