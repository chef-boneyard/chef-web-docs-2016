The definition is improved by rewriting it as a custom resource:

.. code-block:: ruby

   property :port, Integer, default: 4000
   property :hostname, String, name_property: true

   action :create do

     directory "/etc/#{hostname}" do
       recursive true
     end

     file "/etc/#{hostname}/#{port}" do
       content 'some content'
     end

   end

Once built, the custom resource may be used in a recipe just like the any of the resources that are built into |chef|. The resource gets its name from the cookbook and from the file name in the ``/resources`` directory, with an underscore (``_``) separating them. For example, a cookbook named ``host`` with a custom resource in the ``/resources`` directory named ``porter.rb``. Use it in a recipe like this:

.. code-block:: ruby

   host_porter node['hostname'] do
     port 4000
   end

or:

.. code-block:: ruby

   host_porter 'www1' do
     port 4001
   end
