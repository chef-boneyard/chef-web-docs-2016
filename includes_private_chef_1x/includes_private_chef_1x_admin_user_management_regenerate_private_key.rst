Each user account on a |chef private| server has a private key that allows them API access to |chef private|. The |chef private| server does not store a copy of this key. If you misplace this key, it must be regenerated in order to restore API access for that user. This key can be regenerated from each user's profile page. Only the user for each account can regenerate their private key.
