The three supported |chef private| topologies discussed in this guide are the product of our experiences with |chef hosted| and, we feel, will provide our customers with the best |chef| platform for their environments.

|chef private| is software, and many of the components are familiar to our customers and in use in other parts of their environments. However, we have provided you with the best configuration for these components to meet the needs and idiosyncrasies of |chef private|.

By employing one of the three topologies discussed in this guide, our support team will be able to help you with any issues that may arise in your environment, and we’ll be able to deliver you updates and upgrades in a consistent manner that will keep your data safe. Deviation from these topologies reduces our capability to help you when things don’t work as they should, and that makes us sad.

We know that many of our customers are talented and knowledgeable technical people, and have experience running many of the components that are included as part of |chef private|. Your environment may have an existing run book or best practice for any or all of these components individually already. We ask that you treat your |chef private| system as its own entity for optimal performance.

We value your feedback and input on any questions, concerns, and issues you have with |chef private|. Our team is open to suggestions and community participation is encouraged, especially on our IRC channel and at our events. While we are not able to make extensive customizations for |chef private| installations, your feedback will help us decide on future development on the product for which |company_name| officially provides support.

The rest of this document serves as a FAQ of commonly requested modifications to |chef private|.
