The following assumptions exist when |chef private| is deployed in a High Availability topology:

* The back-end processes run on two hosts: ``BE1`` and ``BE2``. ``BE1`` is the |drbd| primary and |chef private| master; ``BE2`` is the |drbd| secondary and the |chef private| backup
* The back-end uses |keepalived| and a dedicated network interface for heartbeat
* The back-end uses |drbd| for file redundancy

On each host, its own status is reported first, and then the status of its remote partner.

When both the primary and secondary nodes are running and behaving as expected, the contents of ``/proc/drbd`` on the primary node will look similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   version: 8.4.0 (api:1/proto:86-100)
   GIT-hash: 28753f559ab51b549d16bcf487fe625d5919c49c build by root@localhost.localdomain, 2012-02-06 12:59:36

On the secondary node, the status will look similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   version: 8.4.1 (api:1/proto:86-100)
   GIT-hash: 91b4c048c1a0e06777b5f65d312b38d47abaea80 build by dag@Build64R6, 2011-12-21 06:08:50
