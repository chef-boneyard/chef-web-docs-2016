One thing we definitely love about technology and our community is how many ways there are to accomplish a goal. We’ve learned a lot about what works best for |chef|, and over its short lifetime have made various fundamental changes to the technologies we use. It’s totally awesome that you love technology X, but we don’t feel it’s a good fit for us at this time. We might look at it in the future, or we may have already cooked something up in our test kitchens that didn’t meet our needs. It’s still cool, though!
