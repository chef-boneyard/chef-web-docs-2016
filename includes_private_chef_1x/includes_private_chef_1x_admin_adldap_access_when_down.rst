In the event that the |microsoft ad| or |ldap| server goes down or becomes unreachable it is still possible for a user to log into |chef private| as long as they have a system recovery password set on their |chef private| account.

To set or remove a system recovery password for a user, see the instructions in the |private chef ctl| password section of this guide.

Once a user has a system recovery password, they can log into the system by clicking the System Recovery link found on the right hand side of the login page.

Once on the System Recovery page, the user will be asked to enter their username and system recovery password.

Once the user successfully logs in, they will gain access to the system and see the same screens as if |microsoft ad| or |ldap| were functioning.

If a user does not have a system recovery password enabled for their account (even if they have a system recovery password set) they will be redirected to the login page and a message will be shown stating that they do not have System Recovery enabled and to contact the system administrator.
