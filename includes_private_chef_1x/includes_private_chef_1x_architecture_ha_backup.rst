|opscode| recommends that the back-end systems be backed up using |lvm| snapshots or some other third-party software that provides for the same type of functionality. The data written and accessed by the |chef private| back-end servers is stored in ``/var/opt/opscode``. There are also key files stored in ``/etc/opscode``, which are required for the front-end hosts to access the data processes on the back-end hosts. The files in ``/etc/opscode`` should be part of the backup strategy.
