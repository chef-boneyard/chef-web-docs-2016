We realize that many of our customers have production environments that provide support for highly available external storage systems. There are a number of such systems available commercially, and providing extensive customer support for |chef private| on all of them is outside our scope.

If your team decides that your |chef private| back-end must be attached to external storage, please let your |opscode| sales representative know as early as possible, and notify your installation consultant if one has been assigned.

The tooling provided with |chef private| and |private chef ctl| will not be modified to be made aware of your environment, which means that the automatic failover of your system will become a manual process or otherwise automated by your team. Such modifications should be carefully documented, as any upgrade process to future versions of |chef private| will need to include those changes. It is not recommended that you make extensive modifications to the software delivered in ``/opt/opscode``.
