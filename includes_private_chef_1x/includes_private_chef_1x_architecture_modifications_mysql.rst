As of this writing, your |chef private| installation will run with a |postgresql| back-end. This decision was the culmination of a lengthy performance review of various data store technologies, as well as a careful review of the legalities of shipping you |chef private| with components of differing license types.

At some point in the not-far-off future, |mysql| will be supported as a datastore option in place of |postgresql| for |chef private| installations. When we are ready to fully support |mysql| for our customers, we will provide you with a supported migration path to ensure that your environment is fully functional after the switch.

Until that time, all |chef private| installations will run |postgresql|. We will be letting our customers know when |mysql| will be available.
