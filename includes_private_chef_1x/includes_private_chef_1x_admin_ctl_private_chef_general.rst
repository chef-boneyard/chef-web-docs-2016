   * - Command
     - Description
   * - ``help``
     - Use to print a list of all available |private chef ctl| commands.
   * - ``reconfigure``
     - Use when changes are made to the |private chef rb| file to reconfigure the server. When changes are made to the |private chef rb| file, they will not be applied to the |chef private| configuration until after this command is run.
   * - ``show-config``
     - Use to view the configuration that will be generated by the ``private-chef-ctl reconfigure`` command. This command is most useful in the early stages of a deployment to ensure that everything is built properly prior to installation.
   * - ``cleanse``
     - Use this command to re-set the server to the state it was in before the first time the ``private-chef-ctl reconfigure`` is run to destroy all data, configuration files, and logs.
   * - ``uninstall``
     - Use before removing |chef private| from a system to remove |chef private|, but not remove any of its data. This will shut down all services (including the ``runit`` process supervisor). To revert the ``private-chef-ctl uninstall`` command, run ``private chef ctl reconfigure`` (because the ``private-chef-ctl start`` command is disabled by the ``private-chef-ctl uninstall`` command).
