In the High Availability configuration, setup of |chef private| happens in two phases - the first phase configures |drbd|, and then pauses to allow you to finish establishing |drbd| replication before moving on:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ private-chef-ctl reconfigure

The installer will pause, asking you to confirm that you have set up |drbd|. Press ``CTRL-C`` to exit, and continue the last few steps require to set up |drbd|:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ drbdadm create-md pc0
   $ drbdadm up pc0
