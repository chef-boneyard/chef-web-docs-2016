Each phase of the project will have one or more To-Do lists created, which are used to track deliverables (both from |opscode| to you, and from you to |opscode|.) As each task is performed, it will be crossed off the list---**To-Do** lists are a great way to see, at a glance, how the work on your project is going, and how much work remains.

Most often, you will be accessing the **To-Do** tab to either review a particular phases status, or to cross off a **To-Do** item yourself.

To access the**To-Do** lists:

#. Click the **To-Dos** tab.
#. From here, you can easily view all of the active **To-Do** lists. To cross off an item, simply click the checkbox.
