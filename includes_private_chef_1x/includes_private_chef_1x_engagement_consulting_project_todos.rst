Each phase of the project will have one or more To-Do lists created, which are used to track deliverables (both from |opscode| to You, and from You to |opscode|.) As each task is performed, it will be crossed off the list---To-Do lists are a great way to see, at a glance, how the work on your project is going, and how much work remains.

Most often, you will be accessing the To-Do tab to either review a particular phases status, or to cross off a To-Do item yourself.

To access the To-Do lists:

#. Click the To-Dos tab.

#. From here, you can easily view all of the active To-Do lists. To cross off an item, simply click the checkbox.
