For users who have not previously logged into |chef private|, they will log in using their |microsoft ad| or |ldap| credentials. After the initial login, each user will be presented with a screen asking them if they would like to create a new user with an account name derived from their login name, or if they would like to link their |microsoft ad| or |ldap| account to an existing |chef private| user account.

Once the user creates their new account they will be taken to the organization page, just as any other user would upon logging in. The user will not be shown the link account page again after their credentials are linked to a |chef private| account.
