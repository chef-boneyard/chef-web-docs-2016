For users who have never logged into |chef private| before, they will simply log in using their Active Directory / LDAP credentials. Once they log in they will be presented with a screen asking if they would like to create a new user with an account name derived from their login name, or if they would like to link their Active Directory / LDAP account to an existing |chef private| user account.

Once the user creates their new account they will be taken to the organization page, just as any other user would upon logging in. The user will not be shown the link account page again, now that their Active Directory / LDAP credentials are linked to a |chef private| account.
