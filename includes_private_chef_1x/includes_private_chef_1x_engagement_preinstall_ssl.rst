|chef private| uses |ssl| to encrypt traffic between every |chef client| and the |chef server|. As part of the server and network requirements, you will give each of the systems hostnames in DNS. Once you have supplied these hostnames, you will need to either:

* Provide |ssl| certificates for the Hostnames
* Allow us to provide self-signed certificates

Let us know your preference by replying to the |ssl| message:
