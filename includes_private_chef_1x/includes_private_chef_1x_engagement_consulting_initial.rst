You will be provided with access to a client-specific project portal, through which we coordinate and share the progress on the scope of work, and where you can ask questions of the |opscode| staff. In order to access the client portal, you must provide |opscode| the following information about your company:

* Company name
* Mailing address
* Country
* Time zone (for the primary contact)
* Web address
* Phone number
* Fax number
* Primary point of contact

Your primary point of contact should be empowered to make decisions on behalf of the company regarding the work performed, and will be our point of contact for any questions that come up during the engagement. Additionally, you may provide up to 5 other individuals who can access the client portal. For each individual, you must provide |opscode| the following:

* Full name
* Email
* Title
* Office phone number, including extension
* Mobile phone number
* Fax number
* Preferred instant messaging name (on Skype, Google, or MSN)

This information should be sent via email to consulting@opscode.com.

Each point of contact will receive an email inviting them to join the |opscode| Client Portal, and will then have access to the project we’re using to manage your |chef private| installation. Login information will be included in this email.

|opscode| will provide you with a Primary Consultant, who will be your primary point of contact for the engagement, and a Secondary Consultant, who will be available in the absence of the Primary Consultant. |opscode| may assign new consultants, either in addition to or in place of, those initially assigned.
