When the acting backup server fails, |drbd| on the master will continue to function in primary mode, whether the |drbd| on the secondary was shut down gracefully or became unavailable unexpectedly. Verify that |drbd| is functioning by running ``drbdadm role pc0`` on the primary:

.. code-block:: bash

   [root@be1 opscode]# drbdadm role pc0
   Primary/Unknown
   [root@be1 opscode]#

You can see the full status by running cat ``/proc/drbd``:

.. code-block:: bash

   version: 8.4.0 (api:1/proto:86-100)
   GIT-hash: 28753f559ab51b549d16bcf487fe625d5919c49c build by    root@localhost.localdomain, 2012-02-06 12:59:36

       ns:672 nr:0 dw:24 dr:1697 al:2 bm:0 lo:0 pe:0 ua:0 ap:0 ep:1 wo:b oos:130760

The disk partition is still mounted into the file system and can be used as normal.

When the secondary becomes available again, two things may happen:

* If the status of the secondary reports ``Inconsistent`` or ``UpToDate`` without manual intervention, all is well.
* If it remains ``DUnknown``, |drbd| on the secondary can be manually restarted and it will start to sync. The ``DUnknown`` status is the report which indicates that |drbd| sees no network connection to its partner.

The last field in the ``/prod/drbd`` file (``oos``) reports how far the primary is out of sync with its partner. If the secondary is down and there are a lot of writes on the primary, this number will increase. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   version: 8.4.0 (api:1/proto:86-100)
   GIT-hash: 28753f559ab51b549d16bcf487fe625d5919c49c build by root@localhost.localdomain, 2012-02-06 12:59:36

When the disks return to a synced state, that field will return to ``0``. While the secondary is syncing, status about the syncing process will be shown for both hosts. For the secondary, something like the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   GIT-hash: 91b4c048c1a0e06777b5f65d312b38d47abaea80 build by dag@Build64R6, 2011-12-21 06:08:50

           finish: 0:00:47 speed: 35,152 (18,124) want: 44,520 K/sec

and for the primary, something like the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   version: 8.4.0 (api:1/proto:86-100)
   GIT-hash: 28753f559ab51b549d16bcf487fe625d5919c49c build by root@localhost.localdomain, 2012-02-06 12:59:36

           finish: 0:00:32 speed: 34,328 (21,304) K/sec

Eventually the hosts will quiesce and report ``ds:UpToDate/UpToDate``. Depending on how long the secondary was down, how much data was written to the primary in the interim, and the speed of the shared network, this process could be nearly instantaneous, or could take several minutes. Your |chef private| processes should not need to be manipulated in any way during this recovery.

If the secondary host is lost completely, a new host can be installed in its place, the device built, and then |drbd| started. The new host will pair with the existing primary, sync data, and be ready to take over if necessary.
