A **Writeboard** provides a collaborative workspace for editing documents. In many cases, |opscode| uses them to provide a starting place for customer requirements or prerequisites. As we learn more about the environment, we will collaboratively edit the **Writeboard** to update it with the most relevant data.

For example, on |chef private| installation engagements, a **Writeboard** is created to track any changes to server specifications, and to keep notes during the engagement.

To access a **Writeboard**:

#. Click the **Writeboards** tab.
#. Select the **Writeboard** you wish to view or edit.
#. Once viewing the **Writeboard**, you can click the **Edit this page** button to edit, or simply scroll to view the document.
