.. warning:: The entire contents of ``/etc/opscode`` must be copied from the backend master to all of the other members of the cluster. There may be new configuration state generated as a result of bootstrapping the first member of the cluster which must agree on all cluster members.

The entire contents of ``/etc/opscode`` on the backend master must now be copied to the other cluster members. The easiest way to accomplish this is to have |ssh| root trust and logins setup between all the cluster members and to copy the contents around from the backend master. In a cluster with back-end master named ``be1``, back-end slave named ``be2``, and front-end servers ``fe1`` and ``fe2`` this might look like:

.. code-block:: bash

   be1# scp /etc/opscode/* fe1:/etc/opscode
   be1# scp /etc/opscode/* fe2:/etc/opscode
   be1# scp /etc/opscode/* be2:/etc/opscode

The details of how to accomplish shipping this data between servers will vary from site to site, please use any available ``scp`` and ``rsync`` tools.

For example, a particularly simple method is to configure |ssh| agent forwarding on a workstation. A successful authentication and login of the user from the workstation to ``be1`` can be passed through from ``be1`` to the other members of the cluster, just by initiating a connection to them from ``be1``.
