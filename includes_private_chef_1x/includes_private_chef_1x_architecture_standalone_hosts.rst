A Standalone |chef private| host can be a virtual host with at least 5GB of free space in ``/var`` and ``/opt``. It should have at least 4GB of RAM and 4 total cores. This smaller architecture is well suited for proofs of concept or otherwise restricted environments. A full list of host requirements is listed in the installation guide.
