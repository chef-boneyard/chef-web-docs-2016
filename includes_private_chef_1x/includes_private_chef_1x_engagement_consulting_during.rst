As work progresses on your project, we will be keeping in touch via the project portal. As tasks are completed, we will be checking them off the relevant **To-Do** lists, and we will be posting a summary status message for each day that work occurs on your project, reviewing the progress that day.

If you have questions about the project, please post a message to the portal.
