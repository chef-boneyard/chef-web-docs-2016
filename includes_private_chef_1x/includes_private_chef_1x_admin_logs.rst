All logs generated by |chef private| can be found in ``/var/log/opscode``. Each service enabled on a system has a sub-directory containing all of its logs.

There are two categories of logs that are produced by |chef private| services:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 420
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Log Type
     - Description
   * - Supervisor
     - These are created and managed directly by the service supervisor, and are automatically rotated when a the current log file reaches 1,000,000 bytes. 10 log files are kept. The latest supervisor log is always located in ``/var/log/opscode/SERVICENAME/current`` and rotated logs have a filename starting with ``@`` followed by a precise ``tai64n`` timestamp based on when the file was rotated.
   * - Application
     - These are created by the services directly, and may require you to apply the log rotation policies that make sense for your organization and operating system.
