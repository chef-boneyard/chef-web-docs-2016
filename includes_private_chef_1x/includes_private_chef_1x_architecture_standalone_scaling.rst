The Standalone configuration is not meant to be scaled. This configuration is explicitly to provide you with a |chef private| alternative for small, temporary, or fenced environments that will not service many nodes. To scale a |chef private| installation up from Standalone, youâ€™ll want to take a look at either the Tiered or High Availability topologies for |chef private|.
