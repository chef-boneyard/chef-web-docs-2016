When the engagement is finished, we will post any final deliverables to your project portal and will schedule an acceptance meeting. In this meeting, we will review the acceptance criteria for your project, and ensure that you are satisfied with results. When both you and |opscode| have signed off on the acceptance criteria, the engagement is complete.

In addition to the acceptance meeting, we will schedule a short customer satisfaction meeting to review your experience with |opscode| Consulting. We encourage you to be as candid as possible---only through understanding your experience can we ensure the quality of our work, both for your company and those we engage with in the future.
