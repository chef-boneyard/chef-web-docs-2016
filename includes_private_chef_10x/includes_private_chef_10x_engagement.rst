Congratulations on your purchase of |chef private|! This document serves as your guide to working with |opscode| to install a fully functioning and supported |chef private| environment.

Each |chef private| installation is a little different. In order to accommodate this reality, each installation is coordinated and performed by our Consulting group.

This document covers:

#. Familiarizing you with how to work with |opscode| Consulting
#. The pre-installation process, detailing all of the things you’ll need to have prepared before your consultant comes on site
#. An overview of the work that will be performed on-site
#. Details of the criteria by which you and |opscode| can be certain the work has been completed

|opscode| looks forward to learning about your environment, and then working with you to ensure you have the highest degree of satisfaction with your |chef private| deployment
