The ``chefignore`` file is used to tell |knife| which cookbook files in the |chef| repository should be ignored when uploading data to the |chef server|. The type of data that should be ignored includes swap files, version control data, build output data, and so on. The ``chefignore`` file uses the ``File.fnmatch`` |ruby| syntax to define the ignore patterns using ``*``, ``**``, and ``?`` wildcards.

* A pattern is relative to the cookbook root
* A pattern may contain relative directory names
* A pattern may match all files in a directory

The ``chefignore`` file is located at the root of the ``/cookbooks`` subdirectory in the |chef| repository. It should contain sections similar to the following:

.. code-block:: basemake

   # section
   *ignore_pattern

   # section
   ignore_pattern*
   
   # section
   **ignore_pattern

   # section
   ignore_pattern**
   
   # section
   ?ignore_pattern

   # section
   ignore_pattern?
