There are two ways to create a |chef| repository: 

* Clone the |opscode| repository for |chef| from |github|
* Download the repository as a |tar gz| file and place it into local version source control.

.. note:: |opscode| strongly recommends using some type of version control tool to manage the source code in the |chef| repository. We use |git| for everything, including for cookbooks. If another version source control system is preferred over |git| (such as |svn|, |mercurial|, or |bazaar|) that is just fine.
