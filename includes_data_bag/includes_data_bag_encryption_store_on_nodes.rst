An encryption key can also be stored in an alternate file on the nodes that need it and specify the path location to the file inside an attribute; however, ``EncryptedDataBagItem.load`` expects to see the actual secret as the third argument, rather than a path to the secret file. In this case, you can use ``EncryptedDataBagItem.load_secret`` to slurp the secret file contents and then pass them:

.. code-block:: ruby

   # inside your attribute file:
   # default[:mysql][:secretpath] = "C:\\chef\\any_secret_filename"
   #
   # inside your recipe:
   # look for secret in file pointed to by mysql attribute :secretpath
   mysql_secret = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load_secret("#{node[:mysql][:secretpath]}")
   mysql_creds = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load("passwords", "mysql", mysql_secret)
   mysql_creds["pass"] # will be decrypted
