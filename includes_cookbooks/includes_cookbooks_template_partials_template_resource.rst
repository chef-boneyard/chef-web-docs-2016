The |resource template| resource can be used to reference a partial template file by using the ``variables`` parameter, the ``:partials`` option, and a |hash| of partial template files. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   template "/file/name.txt" do
     variables :partials => {
       "partial_name_1.txt.erb" => "message",
       "partial_name_2.txt.erb" => "message",
       "partial_name_3.txt.erb" => "message"
     },
   end

where each of the partial template files can then be combined using normal |ruby| template patterns within a template file, such as:

.. code-block:: ruby

   <% @partials.each do |partial, message| %>
     Here is <%= partial %>
   <%= render partial, :variables => {:message => message} %>
   <% end %>
