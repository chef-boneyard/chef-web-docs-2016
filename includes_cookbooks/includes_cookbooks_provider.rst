A resource represents a piece of the system, its current state, and the action that is needed to move it to a desired state. A provider defines the steps that are required to bring that piece of the system from its current to the desired state. An action is de-coupled from the steps required to complete that action, which means that a provider exists for each of the paths that are required to complete the action. This is important because a single action may require different steps, depending on the platform of the system on which the action is being taken.

For example, "install a package" is a single action. To install a package onto various platforms, the steps required for each of those platforms may be different and may require different providers. On a |redhat| or |centos| machine a provider will use the |redhat yum| package provider to get the package installed and on a |debian| or an |ubuntu| machine, a provider will use the |apt| package installer. One action, two providers, each taking only the steps required to complete that action.
