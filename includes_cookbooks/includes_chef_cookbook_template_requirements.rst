To use a template, two things must happen:

1. A template resource must be added to a recipe
2. An |erb| template must be added to a cookbook

For example, the following template file and template resource settings can be used to manage a configuration file named ``/etc/sudoers``. Within a cookbook that uses |sudo|, the following resource could be added to ``recipes/default.rb`` **(jamescott: SWAP/PATH)**::

   template "/etc/sudoers" do
     source "sudoers.erb"
     mode 0440
     owner "root"
     group "root"
     variables({
        :sudoers_groups => node[:authorization][:sudo][:groups],
        :sudoers_users => node[:authorization][:sudo][:users]
     })
   end
   
**jamescott: it would be ideal if we could put some explanation around what this resource does.** 

And then create a template called ``sudoers.erb`` and save it to ``templates/default/sudoers.erb``::

   #
   # /etc/sudoers
   #
   # Generated by Chef for <%= node[:fqdn] %> 
   #
    
   Defaults        !lecture,tty_tickets,!fqdn
    
   # User privilege specification
   root          ALL=(ALL) ALL
    
   <% @sudoers_users.each do |user| -%>
   <%= user %>   ALL=(ALL) <%= "NOPASSWD:" if @passwordless %>ALL
   <% end -%>
    
   # Members of the sysadmin group may gain root privileges
   %sysadmin     ALL=(ALL) <%= "NOPASSWD:" if @passwordless %>ALL 
   
   <% @sudoers_groups.each do |group| -%>
   # Members of the group '<%= group %>' may gain root privileges
   %<%= group %> ALL=(ALL) <%= "NOPASSWD:" if @passwordless %>ALL
   <% end -%>

**jamescott: it would be ideal if we could put some explanation around what this template does.** 

And then set the default attributes in ``attributes/default.rb`` **(jamescott: NEED PATH/SWAP)**::

   default["authorization"]["sudo"]["groups"] = [ "sysadmin","wheel","admin" ]
   default["authorization"]["sudo"]["users"]  = [ "jerry","greg"]
