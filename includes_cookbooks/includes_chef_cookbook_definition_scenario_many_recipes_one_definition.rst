.. The contents of this file are included in multiple topics.

Data can be passed to a definition from more than one recipe. For example, when both ``/etc/aliases`` and ``/etc/sudoers`` require updates from multiple recipes during a single |chef| run. A definition file that reopens resources would look something like:

.. code-block:: ruby

   define :email_alias, :recipients => [] do
     execute "newaliases" do
       action :nothing
     end
    
     t = nil
     begin
       t = resources(:template => "/etc/aliases")
     rescue Chef::Exceptions::ResourceNotFound
       t = template "/etc/aliases" do
         source "aliases.erb"
         cookbook "aliases"
         variables({:aliases => {} })
         notifies :run, "execute[newaliases]"
       end
     end
   
     if not t.variables[:aliases].has_key?(params[:name])
       t.variables[:aliases][params[:name]] = []
     end
     t.variables[:aliases][params[:name]] << [ params[:recipients] ]
   end
