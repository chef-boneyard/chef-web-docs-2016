The results of a search query can be loaded into a recipe. For example, a very simple search query (in a recipe) might look like this::

   search(:node, "attribute:value")

A search query can be assigned to variables and then used elsewhere in a recipe. For example, to search for all nodes that have a role assignment named "webserver", and then render a template which includes those role assignments::

   webservers = search(:node, "role:webserver")::
   
   template "/tmp/list_of_webservers" do
     source "list_of_webservers.erb"
     variables(:webservers => webservers)
   end
