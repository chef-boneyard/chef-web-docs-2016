An environment can use version constraints to specify a list of allowed cookbook versions by specifying the cookbook's name along with the version constraint. For example::

   cookbook "apache2", "~> 1.2.3"

Or::

   cookbook "runit", "= 4.2.0"

If a cookbook is not explicitly given a version constraint the environment will assume the cookbook has no version constraint and will use any version of that cookbook with any node in the environment.
