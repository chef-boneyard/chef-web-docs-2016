A definition is used to create a new resource by stringing together one (or more) existing resources. A definition is not a resource and does not take any actions by itself. A definition is replaced by one (or more) resources, and it then takes actions on behalf of those resources. There is no limit to the number of resources that can be part of a definition. All definitions within a cookbook must be located in the definitions folder **(jamescott: need path/swap)**. A definition is never declared into a cookbook. A definition is best-used when:

* Data needs to be passed from one (or more) recipes into a single definition
* A repeating usage pattern exists for one (or more) resources
* An action does not need to be sent directly to a resource (when it does, it should be sent to a provider)
