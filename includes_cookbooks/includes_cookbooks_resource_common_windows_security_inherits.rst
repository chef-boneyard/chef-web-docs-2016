By default, a file or directory inherits rights from its parent directory. Most of the time this is the preferred behavior, but sometimes it may be necessary to take steps to more specifically control rights. The ``inherits`` attribute can be used to specifically tell |chef| to apply (or not apply) inherited rights from its parent directory.

For example, the following example specifies the rights for a directory:

.. code-block:: ruby

   directory 'C:\mordor' do
     rights :read, 'MORDOR\Minions'
     rights :full_control, 'MORDOR\Sauron'
   end

and then the following example specifies how to use inheritance to deny access to the child directory:

.. code-block:: ruby

   directory 'C:\mordor\mount_doom' do
     rights :full_control, 'MORDOR\Sauron'
     inherits false # Sauron is the only person who should have any sort of access
   end

If the ``:deny`` permission were to be used instead, something could slip through unless all users and groups were denied.

Another example also shows how to specify rights for a directory:

.. code-block:: ruby

   directory 'C:\mordor' do
     rights :read, 'MORDOR\Minions'
     rights :full_control, 'MORDOR\Sauron'
     rights :write, 'SHIRE\Frodo' # Who put that there I didn't put that there
   end
 
but then not use the ``inherits`` attribute to deny those rights on a child directory:

.. code-block:: ruby

   directory 'C:\mordor\mount_doom' do
     rights :deny, 'MORDOR\Minions' # Oops, not specific enough
   end

Because the ``inherits`` attribute is not specified, |chef| will default it to ``true``, which will ensure that security settings for existing files remain unchanged.
