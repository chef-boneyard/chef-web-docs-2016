If a cookbook has a dependency on a recipe that is located in another cookbook, that dependency must be declared in the |metadata rb| file for that cookbook using the ``depends`` keyword.

.. note:: Declaring cookbook dependencies is not required with |chef solo|.

For example, if the following recipe is included in a cookbook named "my_app"::

   include_recipe "apache2::mod_ssl"

Then the |metadata rb| file for that cookbook would have::

   depends "apache2"
